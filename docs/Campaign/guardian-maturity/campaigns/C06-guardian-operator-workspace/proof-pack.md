### Next Task
**C06-T002: Define Guardian Operator Workspace surface contract**

---

## C06-T002: Surface Contract (2026-06-19 09:10 UTC)

### Context
- **Branch**: `codex/campaignOS` | **Commit**: `905234bcb` | **Worktree**: clean

### Files Created/Modified
- `surface-contract.md` — created (19 sections)
- `backlog.md` — C06-T002 marked `go`
- `proof-pack.md` — this section added
- `decision-log.md` — C06-D002 appended

### Inputs Read
All 34 required pre-reads available. No missing inputs.

### Surface Contract Result
19-section contract covering: gate, scope, truth after C06-T001, workspace purpose, surface model, source-of-truth mapping, read-only interaction rules, evidence state model, redaction/truth-labeling rules, unavailable/deferred states, non-goals, implementation readiness, backlog, release boundary.

### Surface Model
8 top-level zones: Workspace Header, Work-Order Status Card, Command-Run Evidence Card, Tool-Turn Observability Card, Receipt Evidence Card, Runtime/Health Card, Gaps and Unavailable Card, Safety Boundary Note.

5 safe to compose now, 1 conditional (tool-turn), 2 new (gaps/safety).

### Source-of-Truth Mapping
8-row table mapping each zone to frontend source, backend route, durable store, proof artifact, known limitation.

### Read-Only Interaction Rules
3 allowed interactions (navigate, refresh, copy public IDs). 11 prohibited interactions (dispatch, execute, retry, replay, approve, complete, create artifact/receipt, mutate state, invoke Pi/Coder, invoke tool loops).

### Evidence State Model
7 canonical states: available, unavailable, deferred, loading, error, stale, diagnostic-only. Each with user-facing label, usage rule, and what-not-to-imply.

### Redaction and Truth-Labeling
10 forbidden content types. 5 truth-label templates (tool-turn, command-run, receipt, work-order, health).

### Unavailable/Deferred States
6 items recorded: receipt linkage, assistant_message_id, workspace composition, EventConsole, manifest, latest-run bridge.

### Validation
```
git diff --check              clean
python3 scripts/validate_docs.py passed
```

### Gate Decision
**`go`** — C06-T002 accepted. C06-T003 may proceed.

### Next Task
**C06-T003: Add Guardian Operator Workspace lens scaffold**

---

## C06-T003: Lens Scaffold (2026-06-19 09:15 UTC)

### Context
- **Branch**: `codex/campaignOS` | **Commit**: `daba74953` | **Worktree**: clean

### Files Created/Modified
- `GuardianOperatorWorkspaceLens.tsx` — created (read-only, static scaffold, 8 cards + safety boundary)
- `CommandCenterUtilityRail.tsx` — `guardian-workspace` lens id added
- `CommandCenterShell.tsx` — import + switch case wired
- `CommandCenterShell.test.tsx` — 5 new tests
- `CommandCenterUtilityRail.test.tsx` — 2 new tests
- `backlog.md` — C06-T003 marked `go`

### Inputs Read
All 35 required pre-reads available. No missing inputs.

### Lens Scaffold Result
`GuardianOperatorWorkspaceLens` component created. Read-only. No fetch, no API imports, no dynamic imports. Renders 8 cards matching C06-T002 surface contract zones + safety boundary note.

### Utility Rail Wiring
New lens id `guardian-workspace` with label "Workspace", icon `Ω`. Test-proven: renders in rail, `onLensChange("guardian-workspace")` fires on click.

### Shell Wiring
New `guardian-workspace` switch case renders `<GuardianOperatorWorkspaceLens />`. Test-proven: workspace renders when clicked.

### Read-Only / No-Fetch
Component has no `fetch` calls, no `api` imports, no dynamic imports. All content is static scaffold text.

### No Mutation Controls
Test-proven: 7 forbidden button labels absent from workspace. No dispatch, execute, retry, replay, approve, complete, create artifact, create receipt.

### Truth-Labeling
Test-proven: tool-turn card truth-labels bounded evidence (scoped to card to avoid duplicate text across cards). Safety boundary lists 6 unsupported claims: no autonomous delegation, no Pi/Coder execution, no recursive tool loops, no artifact creation, no receipt creation, no work-order completion.

### Validation
```
CommandCenterShell.test.tsx      26 passed (5 workspace + 21 existing)
CommandCenterUtilityRail.test.tsx 16 passed (2 workspace + 14 existing)
-t "CommandCenter|GuardianWorkspace" 74 passed, 756 skipped
git diff --check                clean

### Gate Decision
**`go`** — C06-T003 accepted. C06-T004 may proceed.

### Next Task
**C06-T004: Compose first Guardian Operator Workspace read-only cards**

---

## C06-T004: Compose First Read-Only Cards (2026-06-19 09:30 UTC)

### Context
- **Branch**: `codex/campaignOS` | **Commit**: `4841081ca` | **Worktree**: clean

### Files Modified
- `GuardianOperatorWorkspaceLens.tsx` — rewritten with props + live HealthOverview + live CodingWorkOrdersPanel
- `CommandCenterShell.tsx` — workspace case passes health props
- `backlog.md` — C06-T004 marked `go`

### Inputs Read
All 32 required pre-reads available. No missing inputs.

### Runtime/Health Composition
`HealthOverview` rendered inside workspace section labeled "Runtime / health" with explanatory copy. Props passed from shell: healthItems, lastCheckedAt, loading, onRefresh. No new fetch — uses existing shell prop pipeline.

### Work-Order Composition
`CodingWorkOrdersPanel` rendered inside workspace section labeled "Work-order status" with explanatory copy. No new fetch — panel uses its own existing data fetching. Panel preserves existing C05 tool-turn observability and C03 receipt evidence behavior.

### Static/Deferred Card Preservation
Command-run evidence (deferred), tool-turn observability (conditional, with note about composed panel), receipt evidence (available/composed + deferred receipt linkage), gaps, safety boundary — all preserved as static/deferred cards.

### Shell Prop Wiring
`GuardianOperatorWorkspaceLens` now accepts `GuardianOperatorWorkspaceLensProps` (healthItems, lastCheckedAt, loading, onRefresh). Shell passes these from existing props. No unrelated shell props passed.

### Read-Only / No-New-Fetch
Workspace wrapper adds no new fetch, no new API imports. Composed panels use their own existing fetch behavior (already test-proven in C03/C05).

### No Mutation Controls
Test-proven: 7 forbidden button labels absent from workspace.

### Truth-Labeling
Safety boundary lists 6 unsupported claims. Tool-turn card truth-labels bounded evidence. Receipt card truth-labels receipt evidence.

### Validation
```
CommandCenterShell.test.tsx  26 passed
-t "CommandCenter|CodingWorkOrders|GuardianWorkspace"  96 passed, 753 skipped
git diff --check              clean
python3 scripts/validate_docs.py passed
```

### Gate Decision

### Next Task
**C06-T005: Add Guardian Operator Workspace composition proof**


---

## C06-T004-R1: Composition Proof Closeout (2026-06-19 22:59 UTC)

### Context
- **Branch**: `codex/campaignOS` | **Commit (before)**: `40f90ce4e` | **Worktree**: dirty (uncommitted frontend)
- **Prior `next-proof-needed` reason**: frontend implementation commit missing; composition-specific tests absent.

### Frontend Implementation Commit
`6f3596991` — `feat: compose Guardian Workspace read-only cards`
Contains: `GuardianOperatorWorkspaceLens.tsx` (live HealthOverview + CodingWorkOrdersPanel), `CommandCenterShell.tsx` (health props wiring), `CommandCenterShell.test.tsx` (7 new composition tests).

### Runtime/Health Composition
`HealthOverview` rendered inside `Runtime / health` section. Props from shell: healthItems, lastCheckedAt, loading, onRefresh. Test-proven: `command-center-health-overview` testid found in workspace.

### Health Refresh
"Refresh" button inside HealthOverview calls existing `onRefresh` prop — test-proven.

### Work-Order Composition
`CodingWorkOrdersPanel` rendered inside `Work-order status` section. Test-proven: `coding-work-orders-panel` testid found in workspace.

### Static/Deferred Cards Preserved
Command-run evidence, tool-turn observability (conditional), receipt evidence (available/composed, linkage deferred), gaps, safety boundary — all preserved. Test-proven: deferred cards + safety boundary present after composition.

### No New Mutation Controls
Test-proven: 7 forbidden button labels absent from workspace wrapper.

### Truth-Labeling
Test-proven: safety boundary lists 6 unsupported claims after composition.

### Worktree Clean
`git status`: clean after `6f3596991`.

### Validation
```
CommandCenterShell.test.tsx   33 passed (5 scaffold + 7 composition + 21 existing)
-t "CommandCenter|CodingWorkOrders|GuardianWorkspace"  103 passed, 753 skipped
git diff --check              clean
python3 scripts/validate_docs.py passed
```

### Gate Decision
**`go`** — C06-T004 composition proof complete. C06-T005 may proceed.

### Next Task
**C06-T005: Add Guardian Operator Workspace composition proof**


---

## C06-T005: Composition Proof (2026-06-19 23:15 UTC)

### Context
- **Branch**: `codex/campaignOS` | **Commit**: `e2909d07d` | **Worktree**: clean

### Files Created/Modified
- `composition-proof.md` — created (15 sections)
- `backlog.md` — C06-T005 marked `go`
- `proof-pack.md` — this section added
- `decision-log.md` — C06-D005 appended

### Inputs Read
All 32 required pre-reads available. No missing inputs.

### Composition Proof Artifact
`composition-proof.md` created: 15 sections — gate, scope, truth after C06-T004, composed surfaces table, static/deferred surfaces table, no-new-fetch proof, no-mutation proof, truth-labeling proof, validation evidence, known limitations, release boundary, documentation follow-through.

### Composed Surfaces
2 live cards: `HealthOverview` (runtime/health) and `CodingWorkOrdersPanel` (work-order status). Both read-only, no wrapper mutations.

### Static/Deferred Surfaces
5 cards: command-run evidence (deferred → C06-T006), tool-turn standalone (conditional), receipt standalone (deferred), gaps (static), safety boundary (static).

### No-New-Fetch Proof
Source-verified: no `fetch`, no API imports, no dynamic imports in wrapper. Test-verified: workspace renders without additional API context.

### No-Mutation Proof
8 forbidden controls absent — test-proven in C06-T004-R1.

### Truth-Labeling Proof
6 unsupported claims present in safety boundary — test-proven.

### Known Limitations
10 limitations explicitly recorded.

### Validation
```
git diff --check              clean
python3 scripts/validate_docs.py passed
```

No runtime tests — docs-only proof consolidation.

### Gate Decision
**`go`** — C06-T005 accepted. C06-T006 may proceed.

### Next Task
**C06-T006: Add Guardian Operator Workspace command-run evidence card**


---

## C06-T006: Command-Run Evidence Card (2026-06-19 23:25 UTC)

### Context
- **Branch**: `codex/campaignOS` | **Commit**: `19a26566b` | **Worktree**: clean

### Files Created/Modified
- `GuardianWorkspaceCommandRunEvidenceCard.tsx` — created
- `GuardianOperatorWorkspaceLens.tsx` — static card replaced with live component
- `CommandCenterShell.test.tsx` — 8 new tests
- `backlog.md` — C06-T006 marked `go`

### Source Decision
Uses `useCodingWorkOrders` hook (limit 10) to derive command-run evidence from work-order `latest_run_id` pointers. No new backend routes, no new API helpers. This is the existing Command Center work-order hook — no additional backend changes required.

### Implementation
Card renders: explanatory copy, loading/error/empty/no-pointer/available states, safe fields (work_order_id, title, status, latest_run_id, latest_lease_id, latest_receipt_id), refresh button.

### Safe Fields Rendered
work_order_id, title, status, latest_run_id, latest_lease_id, latest_receipt_id. No raw args, secrets, prompts, extra_meta, result_json, stack traces.

### States
- Loading → "Loading command-run evidence…"
- Error → "Command-run evidence is unavailable from the current workspace source."
- Empty (no work orders) → "No command-run evidence is available from current work-order pointers."
- No-pointer (no latest_run_id) → "Work orders are present, but no latest command-run pointer is recorded."
- Available → safe field cards rendered.

### Read-Only / No Mutation
Refresh button only. No dispatch, execute, retry, replay, approve, complete, create artifact, create receipt controls.

### Truth-Labeling
"A run pointer does not prove artifact creation, receipt creation, Pi/Coder execution, autonomous delegation, or work-order completion."

### Validation
```
CommandCenterShell.test.tsx  41 passed (5 scaffold + 7 composition + 8 cmd-run + 21 existing)
-t "CommandCenter|CodingWorkOrders|GuardianWorkspace"  111 passed, 753 skipped
git diff --check              clean
```

### Gate Decision
**`go`** — C06-T006 accepted. C06-T007 may proceed.

### Next Task
**C06-T007: Add Guardian Operator Workspace standalone tool-turn evidence card**


---

## C06-T006-R1: Docs Validation Closeout (2026-06-19 23:30 UTC)

### Context
- **Branch**: `codex/campaignOS` | **Commit**: `0ce7bdd07` | **Worktree**: clean
- **Prior `next-proof-needed` reason**: `python3 scripts/validate_docs.py` not reported despite C06 docs being modified.

### Source Verification
`GuardianWorkspaceCommandRunEvidenceCard.tsx`: uses `useCodingWorkOrders` (existing hook, no new backend routes). No POST/PUT/PATCH/DELETE. No command invocation routes. No raw args, secrets, prompts, extra_meta, result_json, stack traces.

### Safe Fields
work_order_id, title, status, latest_run_id, latest_lease_id, latest_receipt_id — all safe.

### States
Loading, error, empty, no-pointer, available — all test-proven in CommandCenterShell.

### Validation
```
python3 scripts/validate_docs.py     passed
git diff --check                      clean
CommandCenterShell.test.tsx           41 passed (no new changes needed)
-t "CommandCenter|CodingWorkOrders|GuardianWorkspace"  111 passed
```

### Gate Decision

### Next Task
**C06-T007: Add Guardian Operator Workspace standalone tool-turn evidence card**


---

## C06-T007: Tool-Turn Evidence Card (2026-06-20 09:30 UTC)

### Context
- **Branch**: `codex/campaignOS` | **Commit**: `fdd9eb9ac` | **Worktree**: clean

### Files Created/Modified
- `GuardianWorkspaceToolTurnEvidenceCard.tsx` — created
- `GuardianOperatorWorkspaceLens.tsx` — static card replaced with live component
- `CommandCenterShell.test.tsx` — 9 new tests
- `backlog.md` — C06-T007 marked `go`

### Source Decision
Uses existing C05 read-only route `GET /api/guardian/commands/tool-turns/{message_id}/observability` only when an explicit `assistant_message_id` is available from `useCodingWorkOrders` data. No ID fabrication — only the explicit field is used.

### Explicit Assistant Message ID
Only `assistant_message_id` from work-order records is accepted. No inference from work_order_id, run_id, receipt_id, lease_id, list index, or timestamps. Test-proven: no tool-turns URL called when only non-message-id fields present.

### States
Loading, unavailable (no assistant_message_id), error, empty (no tool-turn evidence), available.

### Safe Fields
assistant_message_id, tool_turn_id, tool_turn_state, loop_stop_reason, command_run_id, command_id, command_status, command_result_summary, command_error_summary, evidence_durability. No raw args, secrets, prompts, extra_meta, result_json, stack traces.

### No Mutation / No Execution
Refresh button only. No dispatch, execute, retry, replay, approve, complete, create artifact, create receipt, run tool, invoke tool controls.

### Truth-Labeling
"does not prove autonomous delegation, Pi/Coder execution, recursive tool use, artifact creation, receipt creation, or work-order completion."

### Validation
```
CommandCenterShell.test.tsx  50 passed (9 tool-turn + 41 existing)

### Source Decision
Uses `useCodingWorkOrders` to derive receipt pointers from `latest_receipt_id`. Richer readback + linkage deferred. No receipt creation, no new backend routes.

### Explicit Receipt Pointer
Only `latest_receipt_id` from work-order records. No inference from status, run_id, command_id, lease_id, or timestamps.

### States
Loading, error, empty (no work orders), no-pointer (no latest_receipt_id), available. Deferred linkage message always visible.

### Safe Fields
work_order_id, title, status, latest_receipt_id, latest_run_id, latest_lease_id. No raw args/secrets/payloads.

### No Mutation / No Creation
Refresh button only. No dispatch, execute, retry, replay, approve, complete, create artifact, create receipt, run tool, invoke tool, merge, mark complete controls.

### Truth-Labeling
6 claims: work-order completion, artifact creation, Pi/Coder execution, autonomous delegation, recursive tool use, successful merge.
