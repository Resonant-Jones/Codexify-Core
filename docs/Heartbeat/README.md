# Heartbeat Orchestrator

## What it is

`scripts/content/run_heartbeat_orchestrator.py` is a deterministic, repo-local
orchestration script that runs the three existing heartbeat scripts in one
command and emits a single dated Markdown report.

The orchestrator is a thin runner — it invokes the child scripts as
subprocesses and aggregates their results. It does **not** duplicate their
implementation logic.

## Which scripts it runs

| Step | Script | Purpose |
|------|--------|---------|
| Beta Release Sentinel | `scripts/release/beta_release_sentinel.py` | Generates beta readiness evidence artifacts |
| Daily Dev Blog Ingestion | `scripts/content/ingest_daily_dev_blog.py` | Ingests a dev blog Markdown source into the website content tree |
| Resonant Constructs Daily Insight | `scripts/content/generate_resonant_daily_insight.py` | Generates a daily insight from local Markdown sources |

Each step can be independently skipped via a `--skip-*` flag.

## How to run

### Makefile (recommended)

```bash
# Full run with all sources
make heartbeat DATE=2026-05-14 \
  DEV_BLOG_SOURCE=docs/Website/dev-blog/README.md \
  INSIGHT_SOURCE="docs/ResonantConstructs/daily-insights/README.md docs/ResonantConstructs/README.md" \
  FORCE=1

# Defaults to today; skips dev-blog and insight unless sources provided
make heartbeat

# Today, with only the dev blog (insight skipped automatically)
make heartbeat DEV_BLOG_SOURCE=docs/Website/dev-blog/README.md FORCE=1

# Today, with only insight sources (dev blog skipped automatically)
make heartbeat INSIGHT_SOURCE="docs/ResonantConstructs/daily-insights/README.md" FORCE=1
```

**Makefile variable behavior:**

| Variable | Default | Effect |
|---|---|---|
| `DATE` | today (`date +%Y-%m-%d`) | Passed as `--date` |
| `DEV_BLOG_SOURCE` | *(empty)* | If set, passed as `--dev-blog-source`; otherwise `--skip-dev-blog` |
| `INSIGHT_SOURCE` | *(empty)* | If set, each word passed as `--insight-source`; otherwise `--skip-daily-insight` |
| `FORCE` | *(unset)* | If `FORCE=1`, passes `--force`; otherwise omitted |

Beta Release Sentinel is **always** run (no skip variable).

The Makefile target is the recommended interface for daily use because it
handles date defaulting, conditional `--skip-*` flags, and `--force` gating.

### pnpm / npm

```bash
pnpm heartbeat -- --date 2026-05-14 --dev-blog-source docs/Website/dev-blog/README.md --insight-source docs/ResonantConstructs/daily-insights/README.md --force
```

Note: The `--` separator is required so pnpm forwards arguments to the Python
script.  Richer argument handling (date defaults, conditional skip flags) is
best done through the Makefile target.

### Direct Python invocation

From the repo root:

```bash
# Full run

```

## Arguments

| Argument | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `--date YYYY-MM-DD` | yes | Date for the heartbeat run |
| `--dev-blog-source PATH` | yes (unless `--skip-dev-blog`) | Path to the Daily Dev Blog Markdown source file |
| `--insight-source PATH` | yes unless `--skip-daily-insight` | Path to a Resonant Constructs insight source file (repeatable) |
| `--output-dir PATH` | no | Output directory for the heartbeat report (default: `docs/Heartbeat/generated`) |
| `--dry-run` | no | Print planned commands and target path without executing or writing |
| `--force` | no | Overwrite existing heartbeat report if present |
| `--skip-beta-sentinel` | no | Skip the Beta Release Sentinel step |
| `--skip-dev-blog` | no | Skip the Daily Dev Blog ingestion step |
| `--skip-daily-insight` | no | Skip the Resonant Constructs Daily Insight step |

## Where generated heartbeat reports go

```
docs/Heartbeat/generated/YYYY-MM-DD-heartbeat.md
```

## How `--dry-run`, `--force`, and skip flags work

- **`--dry-run`**: Prints all planned subprocess commands and the target report
  path. Does **not** execute any child script and does **not** write any files.
- **`--force`**: Allows overwriting an existing heartbeat report for the same
  date. Without `--force`, the orchestrator fails with a clear error if the
  report already exists.
- **`--force` is forwarded** to the Daily Dev Blog and Daily Insight scripts
  (which support it). The Beta Release Sentinel does **not** receive `--force`
  because it does not support that flag.
- **Skip flags** (`--skip-beta-sentinel`, `--skip-dev-blog`,
  `--skip-daily-insight`): Omit the corresponding step entirely. Skipped steps
  are recorded in the heartbeat report with status `skipped`.
- When a `--skip-*` flag is used, the corresponding required source argument
  becomes optional.

## Report contents

Each heartbeat report includes:

- Title: `Heartbeat Orchestrator — YYYY-MM-DD`
- Date and generated timestamp
- Repo status summary (branch, head, worktree cleanliness)
- Run summary table (step name, status, artifacts, notes)
- Generated artifact paths
- Skipped steps
- Warnings
- Failures (with sanitized, bounded captured output)
- Next suggested manual action

Run statuses are limited to three values: `passed`, `failed`, and `skipped`.

## What's deferred

The following are **not** included in this first pass and are deferred to
later tasks:

- Cron scheduling
- Deployment automation
- Email distribution
- Substack publishing
- Codexify website publishing
- External automation
- Command-bus integration
- Runtime worker integration
- Any modification to the child scripts' implementations (unless a minimal
  compatibility fix is required)

## Important caveats

- **Heartbeat reports are local operational artifacts**, not release approval
  by themselves. They capture what happened during a local run of the three
  heartbeat scripts on a given date.
- The orchestrator does **not** publish externally. All output is written to
  the local filesystem.
- The orchestrator does **not** modify runtime, queue, worker, provider,
  retrieval, identity, cron, command bus, or release-gating behavior.
- Captured child script output is sanitized to remove obvious secret-like
  values (API keys, tokens, passwords, private keys).

## Schedule manifest

A declarative JSON manifest at `config/heartbeat/heartbeat.schedule.example.json`
describes the intended heartbeat schedule without implementing it.

- **Schema version:** `heartbeat.schedule.v1`
- **Example schedule:** `daily-local-heartbeat` — manual-only, `enabled: false`
  (no scheduler is active), publication off, review gate on
- **Inputs documented:** `DATE`, `DEV_BLOG_SOURCE`, `INSIGHT_SOURCE`, `FORCE`
- **Review inputs:** `STRICT`
- **Artifact families:** heartbeat report, beta sentinel (md + json),
  dev blog, daily insight

The manifest is validated by `tests/scripts/test_schedule_manifest.py`
(16 tests, no network or external dependencies).

Like everything else in this directory, the manifest is a **specification**,
not an active schedule.  Activation is `manual_only` — the only way to
run the heartbeat today is via `make heartbeat` from the repo root.

### Activation modes

| Mode | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `manual_only` | No scheduler is activated. All runs are manual via `make heartbeat`. **This is the current state.** |
| `local_scheduler_ready` | Manifest validated; a local scheduler (cron, launchd, systemd timer) may be wired in a later task. |
| `future_codexify_cron_ready` | Reserved for a future Codexify-integrated cron or command-bus scheduler. Not implemented. |

**Future scheduling must pass through heartbeat review before publication.**
Any automated pipeline added later must run the review gate (`make heartbeat-review STRICT=1`)
and require `passed` status before proceeding to deployment, email, Substack,
or website publishing.

**Publication targets remain disabled and empty** (`enabled: false`, `targets: []`)
in this task.  No external publishing is wired.

## Staging a heartbeat outbox

The `stage_heartbeat_outbox.py` script copies heartbeat artifacts into a
flat staging directory and generates templated content drafts for downstream
publication channels (all deferred).

### How to run

```bash
# Makefile (recommended)
make heartbeat-stage DATE=2026-05-14
make heartbeat-stage DATE=2026-05-14 FORCE=1
make heartbeat-stage   # defaults to today

# pnpm
pnpm heartbeat:stage -- --date 2026-05-14 --force

# Direct
python scripts/content/stage_heartbeat_outbox.py --date 2026-05-14 --force
python scripts/content/stage_heartbeat_outbox.py --date 2026-05-14 --dry-run
```

Richer argument handling (date defaulting, force gating) is best done
through the Makefile target.

### What it produces

The staging script copies artifacts from the generated directories into
`docs/Heartbeat/staged/YYYY-MM-DD/` and produces:

| File | Description |
|---|---|
| `*-beta-sentinel.{md,json}` | Beta release sentinel artifacts |
| `*-dev-blog.md` | Daily dev blog draft |
| `*-daily-insight.md` | Resonant Constructs daily insight |
| `release-summary.md` | Templated release summary from heartbeat run |
| `website-update.md` | Templated website update draft |
| `substack-draft.md` | Templated Substack newsletter draft |
| `email-draft.md` | Templated email draft |
| `manifest.json` | Staging manifest (`heartbeat.outbox.v1`) |

All drafts include a visible note that they are local staging artifacts,
not published content.

### Safety gates

- **Review required** — the staging script runs `review_heartbeat_run.py --strict`
  before copying.  If review fails, staging is blocked.
- **--skip-review** bypasses the gate but writes a `_SKIP_REVIEW_WARNING.txt`
  file and adds warnings to the result.
- **Secret scan** — after generating drafts, the script scans all staged
  content for secret-like values.  If detected, the offending draft is removed
  and an error is reported.
- **No network calls** — the script operates entirely on the local filesystem.
- **Publication disabled** — the staging manifest records `publication.enabled: false`
  and `targets: []`.

## Inspecting a staged outbox

The `inspect_heartbeat_outbox.py` script reads a staged outbox directory
and validates its contents without modifying anything.  It is a read-only
safety check — unlike staging, which copies files and generates drafts,
inspection only verifies what was already staged.

### How to run

```bash
# Makefile (recommended)
make heartbeat-outbox DATE=2026-05-14
make heartbeat-outbox DATE=2026-05-14 STRICT=1
make heartbeat-outbox   # defaults to today

# pnpm
pnpm heartbeat:outbox -- --date 2026-05-14 --strict

# Direct
python scripts/content/inspect_heartbeat_outbox.py --date 2026-05-14
python scripts/content/inspect_heartbeat_outbox.py --date 2026-05-14 --strict --json
```

Richer argument handling (date defaulting, strict gating) is best done
through the Makefile target.

### What it checks

| Check | Non-strict | Strict |
|---|---|---|
| Staged directory exists for date | `failed` | `failed` |
| `manifest.json` present and valid JSON | `failed` | `failed` |
| `schema_version` is `heartbeat.outbox.v1` | `failed` | `failed` |
| `date` in manifest matches directory name | `failed` | `failed` |
| `publication.enabled` is `false` | `failed` | `failed` |
| `publication.targets` is `[]` | `failed` | `failed` |
| `review_required` is `true` | `failed` | `failed` |
| `review_status` is present | `failed` | `failed` |
| All `generated_files` exist on disk | `warning` | `failed` |
| No secret-like values in staged content | `warning` | `failed` |
| Review gate was skipped | `warning` | `warning` |

### Inspection statuses

| Status | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `passed` | All checks pass, outbox is clean |
| `warning` | Non-critical issues (skip-review, extra files). Review manually. |
| `failed` | Critical issues (missing manifest, wrong schema, publication enabled, missing files). Do not proceed. |

### Difference from staging

- **Staging** (`make heartbeat-stage`) copies artifacts from generated
  directories and creates drafts. It **modifies** the filesystem.
- **Inspection** (`make heartbeat-outbox`) reads the already-staged outbox
  and validates it. It is **read-only** and does not modify files.

Run inspection after staging to verify the outbox before any further
pipeline step.

## Agent Command Center status

Heartbeat pipeline status is visible inside Agent Command Center as a
**read-only** lens (⊛ Heartbeat).  The panel displays:

- Latest heartbeat date
- Review status (passed / warning / failed / missing)
- Outbox status (passed / warning / failed / missing)
- Publication status (always disabled)
- Staged file count
- Warnings and failures if present
- Manual command hint (`make heartbeat-full …`)

The status is fetched via `GET /api/heartbeat/status`, which reads
repo-local artifacts only.  It does **not** run scripts, shell out,
publish, or schedule.

**No run, publish, or schedule buttons are present.**  The surface is
labeled `Read-only`, `Manual-only`, and `Publishing disabled`.  A future
Agent Command Center execution wiring is deferred to a separate
architecture-impact task.

## Local model draft adapter

`scripts/content/generate_local_model_draft.py` is an optional manual adapter
for creating model-assisted Markdown drafts from existing repo-local Markdown
artifacts. It can support future Heartbeat, marketing, release-note, website,
Substack, and email draft lanes, but it is only a drafting helper.

The adapter:

- reads explicit local Markdown source files
- calls an explicitly configured local OpenAI-compatible chat endpoint
- writes one reviewable Markdown draft to the explicit `--output` path
- records source paths, model metadata, a sanitized endpoint label, and the
  required model-assisted draft review note

The adapter does **not** publish, schedule, run Heartbeat, stage an outbox,
inspect an outbox, dispatch commands, call Codexify cron/workers, approve beta
readiness, or mutate source artifacts. Source artifacts remain authoritative;
generated language is draft text only.

### Manual usage

From the repo root:

```bash
CODEXIFY_LOCAL_DRAFT_ENDPOINT=http://localhost:11434/v1 \
CODEXIFY_LOCAL_DRAFT_MODEL=local-test \
python scripts/content/generate_local_model_draft.py \
  --date 2026-05-17 \
  --source docs/Heartbeat/README.md \
  --output docs/Heartbeat/staged/2026-05-17/website-update.model-draft.md \
  --draft-kind website-update
```

Use `--dry-run` to print the planned inputs, output path, provider, model, and
sanitized endpoint without writing a file. Use `--force` only when deliberately
overwriting an existing draft.

### Environment variables

| Variable | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `CODEXIFY_LOCAL_DRAFT_ENDPOINT` | Preferred local OpenAI-compatible endpoint base URL |
| `CODEXIFY_LOCAL_DRAFT_MODEL` | Preferred local draft model name |
| `CODEXIFY_ALLOW_LOCAL_DRAFT_LAN` | Set to `1` to allow local LAN or Tailscale-style IP endpoints |

Fallbacks are `LOCAL_BASE_URL` for the endpoint and `LOCAL_CHAT_MODEL` for the
model. The provider is fixed to `local`. Cloud endpoints are rejected.

### Review and truth boundary

Every generated draft includes:

> Model-assisted draft — review required before publication.

Review is mandatory before any external use. The model may draft wording, but
it must not create truth: it is instructed to use only supplied source text, avoid
invented metrics or release promises, and put unresolved gaps in the draft
instead of filling them in.

Heartbeat orchestration, scheduling, publishing, and release truth-gating remain
deterministic/manual. This adapter does not change the `make heartbeat-full`,
`make heartbeat-review`, `make heartbeat-stage`, or `make heartbeat-outbox`
contracts.
## Full pipeline (`make heartbeat-full`)

The `make heartbeat-full` target runs the complete heartbeat pipeline
end-to-end in a single command: generate → review → stage → inspect.
It stops on the first failed step.

### Usage

```bash
# Full run with content sources
make heartbeat-full \
  DEV_BLOG_SOURCE=docs/Website/dev-blog/README.md \
  INSIGHT_SOURCE="docs/ResonantConstructs/daily-insights/README.md docs/ResonantConstructs/README.md" \
  FORCE=1

# Beta-only run (dev-blog and insight auto-skipped when sources not provided)
make heartbeat-full

# Strict run (warnings treated as failures in review and inspection)
make heartbeat-full STRICT=1

# Custom date
make heartbeat-full DATE=2026-05-14 FORCE=1
```

### What it runs

| Step | Target | What happens |
|---|---|---|
| 1. Generate | `make heartbeat` | Runs Beta Release Sentinel, Daily Dev Blog, Resonant Daily Insight |
| 2. Review | `make heartbeat-review` | Validates the heartbeat report (strict when `STRICT=1`) |
| 3. Stage | `make heartbeat-stage` | Copies artifacts + generates drafts to `docs/Heartbeat/staged/` |
| 4. Inspect | `make heartbeat-outbox` | Validates the staged outbox (strict when `STRICT=1`) |

### Pass-through variables

| Variable | Passed to |
|---|---|
| `DATE` | All four child targets |
| `DEV_BLOG_SOURCE` | `heartbeat` |
| `INSIGHT_SOURCE` | `heartbeat` |
| `FORCE=1` | `heartbeat`, `heartbeat-stage` |
| `STRICT=1` | `heartbeat-review`, `heartbeat-outbox` |

### Caveats

- **Staging requires strict review to pass.** If review fails (e.g., because
  a lane was skipped and `STRICT=1`), staging is blocked and the pipeline
  stops.
- This is the **recommended manual operator command** for running the full
  heartbeat flow.
- **Agent Command Center wiring is deferred** to a separate
  architecture-impact task.  The `heartbeat-full` command creates the
  operator seam that a future ACC task can invoke through a governed path.
- **This does not schedule or publish anything.**  All steps are manual
  and local.

## Reviewing a heartbeat run

The `review_heartbeat_run.py` script validates a heartbeat report without
running the orchestrator.  It checks that the report exists, the title
matches, artifacts are present on disk, no failures are recorded, and no
secret-like values leaked into the report.

**The review command is a safety gate** — it should be run before any
scheduling, deployment, or publication step is added in later tasks.
Passing review confirms that a given heartbeat run is complete and
artifact-intact, but does **not** by itself approve release readiness.

The review command does **not** run the heartbeat orchestrator, publish
externally, or modify any file on disk.

### How to run

```bash
# Makefile (recommended)
make heartbeat-review DATE=2026-05-14
make heartbeat-review DATE=2026-05-14 STRICT=1
make heartbeat-review   # defaults to today

# pnpm
pnpm heartbeat:review -- --date 2026-05-14 --strict

# Direct
python scripts/content/review_heartbeat_run.py --date 2026-05-14
python scripts/content/review_heartbeat_run.py --date 2026-05-14 --strict --json
```

Richer argument handling (date defaulting, strict gating) is best done
through the Makefile target.

### Review statuses

| Status | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `passed` | Report exists, all steps passed, artifacts present, no secrets detected |
| `warning` | Report exists but has issues (failed steps, missing artifacts, title mismatch, secrets) |
| `failed` | Report not found, or `--strict` mode with any issue |

### Arguments

| Argument | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `--date YYYY-MM-DD` | no | Date of the heartbeat run. Defaults to today. |
| `--heartbeat-dir PATH` | no | Directory containing heartbeat reports (default: `docs/Heartbeat/generated`) |
| `--json` | no | Output machine-readable JSON instead of Markdown-ish text |
| `--strict` | no | Treat warnings as failures; skipped or non-passed steps become review failures |

### What it checks

- Heartbeat report exists for the given date
- Report title matches `Heartbeat Orchestrator — YYYY-MM-DD`
- Run summary table is present
- No steps have `failed` status
- Artifacts listed in the report exist on disk
- Report contains no obvious secret-like values (`api_key=`, `token=`,
  `password=`, `secret=`, `oauth`, `cookie`, `Authorization: Bearer`,
  `sk-`, GitHub tokens, JWT, private keys)
