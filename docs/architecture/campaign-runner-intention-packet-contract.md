## Purpose

Campaign Runner has two prompt-governed planning stages:

- Stage A audits the repository and emits `mega_audit_output.schema.json`.
- Stage B compiles Stage-A evidence into campaigns and tasks that conform to `campaign_set.schema.json`.

The Intention Packet gives both stages the same explicit operator-authored objective without requiring ad hoc edits to the prompt templates.

The packet exists to help Campaign Runner produce better bounded campaigns, not broader autonomy.

## Scope

The Intention Packet seam applies only to Campaign Runner prompt assembly for:

- Stage A audit prompting
- Stage B campaign compilation prompting

The packet may constrain:

- audit objective
- scope
- non-goals
- evidence requirements
- campaign-shaping rules
- Codexify task-lane expectations

Nodes in scope:

- operator workstation running `codex_runner/runner.py`
- local repository checkout being audited
- provider adapter lane used by Campaign Runner
- persisted runner artifacts under `docs/_audits/` and `docs/_campaign_runs/`

Trust boundaries:

- operator-authored packet text is trusted only as planning input
- repository evidence remains the source for findings
- runner-owned identifiers and schema validation remain runner authority
- provider output remains untrusted until schema validation passes

Threat model:

- honest-but-buggy operators may overstate the intended target
- provider output may follow packet language beyond repo evidence
- packet text may contain strings that look like runner placeholders
- malicious packet text must not become executable code or override runner-owned values

## Non-Goals

This seam does not:

- add autonomous execution
- add direct Codex or Claude execution paths
- change Pi broker execution semantics
- change provider behavior
- change queue, worker, route, UI, or database behavior
- change schema-required output shapes
- bypass schema validation
- authorize merge automation, lease allocation, or live agent execution
- widen current release support claims
- make the packet an ADR
- make the packet runtime proof

## Contract Shape

The packet is plain UTF-8 markdown text supplied with:

```bash
python codex_runner/runner.py --intention-packet-file /path/to/intention.md
```

When provided:

- the runner reads the file as UTF-8 text
- missing files fail closed
- directory paths fail closed
- the text is treated as inert prompt context
- the same resolved packet text is injected into Stage A and Stage B
- the packet hash is included in deterministic run inputs

When omitted, the runner injects this fallback text:

```text
No explicit intention packet was provided. Use the default repository-grounded audit posture and do not infer a narrower target.
```

The injection placeholder is:

```text
<INTENTION_PACKET>
```

The packet cannot override runner-owned placeholders such as:

- `<AUDIT_ID>`
- `<REPO_ROOT>`
- `<RUN_ID>`
- `<PASTE MEGA_AUDIT_OUTPUT_JSON_HERE>`
- `<AUDIT_JSON>`

The runner replaces placeholders only in the prompt template, not inside inserted packet text or pasted Stage-A JSON.

## Canonical Template and Example

The default operator-facing shape for intention packets is the canonical template:

- [`Campaign Runner Intention Packet Template`](../Campaign/templates/campaign-runner-intention-packet-template.md)

The repo also includes one illustrative example packet:

- [`Provider Readiness Intention Packet Example`](../Campaign/examples/campaign-runner-intention-packet-provider-readiness.md)

Examples are planning artifacts only. They are not proof that a campaign has run, that provider-broker readiness has been validated, or that runtime support exists.

A completed packet must still be read under this contract's invariants, including schema authority, runner-owned constraints, provider governance, Guardian ownership, Pi broker boundaries, and `00-current-state.md`.

## Stage Interpretation Rules

Stage A audits against the packet but must distinguish:

- repo-grounded evidence and findings
- unsupported intention claims
- unknowns requiring discovery

Stage B compiles only from Stage-A evidence. It uses the same packet to filter, prioritize, and constrain campaign synthesis, but the packet cannot create implementation authority by itself.

Discovery-only output is preferred when the packet objective is not repo-supported or when required evidence is missing, contradictory, or only aspirational.

Existing schemas remain authoritative for both stages:

- Stage A must conform to `mega_audit_output.schema.json`.
- Stage B must conform to `campaign_set.schema.json`.
- Packet sections may guide interpretation, but they do not add schema fields, bypass validation, or override runner-owned constraints.

## Task-Lane Classification

Stage B campaign tasks include a required `task_lane` field so reviewers and later artifact-generation work can distinguish the kind of Codexify task being proposed.

Canonical lane values:

- `standard`: ordinary implementation work that does not alter architecture meaning.
- `architecture_impact`: work that affects contracts, runtime semantics, retrieval or routing behavior, queue or worker or acceptance semantics, identity boundaries, operator truth surfaces, canonical token domains, provider governance, Pi boundaries, or anything dangerous to forget in three months.
- `discovery`: read-only or investigation-first work where evidence is insufficient for implementation.
- `docs_only`: documentation edits that do not change architecture meaning or runtime behavior.
- `proof_runbook`: validation, proof capture, operator runbook, smoke-test, or evidence-generation work that proves an existing path without changing runtime behavior.

The lane is campaign-planning metadata only. It is not execution authority, task approval, provider permission, Pi invocation authority, merge permission, or release proof.

When Stage B is uncertain between `standard` and `architecture_impact`, it must choose `architecture_impact`. When Stage-A evidence is insufficient for safe implementation, Stage B must choose `discovery` instead of converting intent into executable work.

No lane widens current release support. `docs/architecture/00-current-state.md` remains authoritative for what is currently supported, proven, blocked, or outside the release promise.

## Reviewable Task Prompt Artifacts

Campaign Runner may materialize reviewable Markdown prompt artifacts for generated campaign tasks. These artifacts are derived from the task object and its `task_lane` value.

Prompt artifacts are not execution authority. They do not approve a task, dispatch a provider, invoke Pi, allocate a lease, merge code, or prove runtime support.

Each generated prompt artifact must remain fenced as a single self-contained task prompt so an operator can review the exact handoff text before any later coding-agent use.

Architecture-impact prompt artifacts must preserve required pre-read, ADR impact, current-truth anchors, invariants, proof surface, and documentation follow-through sections.

Discovery prompt artifacts are preferred when Stage-A evidence is insufficient or when a task lacks enough metadata for safe implementation. Missing metadata should produce explicit `TODO(operator):` placeholders rather than invented claims.

No generated prompt can widen release truth. `docs/architecture/00-current-state.md` remains authoritative for current support and proof claims.

## Provider-Free Fixture Materialization

Provider-free fixture materialization begins after Stage A audit JSON and Stage B campaign JSON already exist.

This mode validates the supplied audit and campaign JSON against the existing Campaign Runner schemas, then materializes review artifacts using the same deterministic campaign/task/prompt artifact machinery as normal materialization.

This is a proof/materialization lane only. It is not execution authority, task approval, provider permission, Pi invocation authority, merge permission, or release proof.

Provider-free fixture materialization must not:

- invoke Stage A or Stage B providers
- render Stage A or Stage B prompts
- execute generated task prompts
- call Pi, Codex, Claude, DeepSeek, Minimax, OpenAI, or any external provider
- change provider behavior, Pi broker behavior, queues, workers, routes, databases, or UI behavior
- prove provider support, Pi execution, runtime readiness, or release readiness

The mode exists so operators can safely prove artifact generation from already-produced fixture JSON while preserving schema authority, runner-owned artifact paths, task-lane metadata, collision guards, and `00-current-state.md` release truth.

## Example Intention Packet

```markdown
# Campaign Runner Intention Packet

Objective:
- Audit whether Campaign Runner can support an explicit operator-authored planning input for Stage A and Stage B.

Scope:
- codex_runner/runner.py
- codex_runner/prompts/mega_audit.md
- codex_runner/prompts/audit_report_to_campaign_runner.md
- codex_runner/tests/
- docs/architecture/

Non-goals:
- Do not add provider behavior.
- Do not add autonomous execution.
- Do not change schemas unless the audit proves a strict need.

Evidence posture:
- Prefer repo-grounded findings.
- Separate implemented behavior from future planning.
- If the repo cannot support an implementation task safely, produce a discovery task.

Campaign shaping:
- Keep tasks independently mergeable.
- Keep release claims subordinate to docs/architecture/00-current-state.md.
```

## Stage A Responsibilities

Stage A must:

- audit against the intention packet
- keep `mega_audit_output.schema.json` authoritative
- preserve runner-owned constraints
- ground findings in repository evidence
- separate repo-grounded findings from unsupported packet claims
- emit discovery-oriented findings when the repository does not support the requested intention
- avoid presenting packet language as proof of runtime capability

Stage A must not:

- infer runtime support from the packet
- invent findings unsupported by repository evidence
- override `audit_id`, `repo.path`, JSON-only mode, or schema requirements

## Stage B Responsibilities

Stage B must:

- use the packet only to interpret and filter Stage-A findings
- keep `campaign_set.schema.json` authoritative
- preserve independently mergeable task scope
- prefer discovery tasks over speculative implementation when evidence is insufficient
- keep campaign and task output grounded in Stage-A evidence
- avoid widening release claims or runtime support claims

Stage B must not:

- invent campaigns or tasks unsupported by Stage-A evidence
- treat the packet as runtime proof
- add git commit instructions unless the current task artifact contract supports them safely
- bypass task scope, file-path, or schema constraints

## Invariants

- The Intention Packet is an operator-authored planning artifact.
- It is not runtime proof.
- It is not an ADR by itself.
- It cannot override schemas.
- It cannot override runner-owned constraints.
- It cannot override provider governance.
- It cannot override Guardian ownership.
- It cannot override Pi broker boundaries.
- It cannot override `00-current-state.md`.
- It cannot introduce autonomous execution.
- It cannot authorize direct provider CLI execution.
- It cannot mutate pasted Stage-A JSON.
- Existing provider output validation remains authoritative.

## Failure Policy

The runner fails closed when:

- `--intention-packet-file` points to a missing file
- `--intention-packet-file` points to a directory
- the file cannot be decoded as UTF-8 text

The runner does not parse, execute, or transform the packet as code.

If the packet asks for behavior unsupported by repository evidence, Stage A should make that lack of support explicit and Stage B should prefer discovery tasks or no campaign over speculative implementation.

## Relationship to Pi Invocation Boundary

The Intention Packet is upstream planning context. It is not a Pi invocation envelope, Pi receipt, harness artifact, command authorization, or result-return proof.

The Pi Invocation Boundary remains the governing contract for future Pi-like harness invocation, including Guardian ownership, command authority, result return, lineage, and provider-lane separation.

This seam does not:

- implement a Pi SDK call
- change Pi broker behavior
- bypass Guardian-mediated coding-agent execution doctrine
- grant command authority to packet text
- make Campaign Runner depend on Pi internals

## Relationship to Current Release Truth

`docs/architecture/00-current-state.md` remains the short-horizon release truth gate.

The Intention Packet can align Campaign Runner planning around a specific objective, but it cannot prove that the objective is implemented, supported, release-ready, or end-to-end live.

Current release truth still forbids assuming:

- UI dispatch
- lease allocation
- live agent execution
- merge automation
- autonomous self-modification
- provider support beyond the proven supported path

This contract adds a bounded prompt-intention input seam only.
