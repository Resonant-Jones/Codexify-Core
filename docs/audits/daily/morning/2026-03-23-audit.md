## Risk Flags
- `chat_depends_on_redis_and_workers`: Chat completion is queue-coupled and depends on Redis plus worker availability. Evidence: `docs/architecture/tech-debt-and-risks.md`, `docs/architecture/roadmap-signals.md`
- `config_split_brain_risk`: Canonical and legacy config paths still coexist, so startup and operator state can drift. Evidence: `docs/architecture/tech-debt-and-risks.md`, `docs/architecture/roadmap-signals.md`
- `legacy_tools_and_command_bus_duality`: Legacy /tools behavior and the command bus still overlap, which increases contract drift risk. Evidence: `docs/architecture/tech-debt-and-risks.md`, `docs/architecture/roadmap-signals.md`
- `sync_not_durable`: Sync subscriptions are still process-local rather than durable across restarts. Evidence: `docs/architecture/tech-debt-and-risks.md`, `docs/architecture/roadmap-signals.md`, `docs/architecture/data-and-storage.md`
- `federation_high_blast_radius`: Federation remains sensitive to trust policy, feature flags, and egress behavior. Evidence: `docs/architecture/tech-debt-and-risks.md`, `docs/architecture/roadmap-signals.md`
