## Runtime Truth

- Status: `WARN`
- Summary: Checks whether current-state release truth and repo-local audit artifacts exist, while preserving the rule that document presence is not live proof.

### Evidence
- docs/architecture/00-current-state.md: current-state release truth anchor present
- docs/architecture/00-current-state.md: explicitly distinguishes live evidence and runtime proof from broader architecture docs
- docs/audits/latest.json: repo-local latest audit JSON artifact present
- docs/audits/latest.md: repo-local latest audit Markdown artifact present

### Warnings
- docs/architecture/00-current-state.md warns that live runtime proof still requires refresh and that Unity Audit is a coherence lens only.

### Manual Review Prompts
- Which supported-path live proof artifact is the freshness anchor for the current main tip?
- Do current health surfaces and worker proofs still match the claims in 00-current-state.md?
- If runtime behavior drifted recently, has current-state been refreshed before using this audit for release confidence?

## Contract Integrity

- Status: `WARN`
- Summary: Checks that the core contract corpus exists and that canonical runtime vocabulary is explicitly separated from implementation proof.

### Evidence
- docs/architecture/chat-runtime-contract.md: chat runtime contract present
- docs/architecture/runtime-protocol-token-contract.md: runtime protocol token contract present
- docs/architecture/account-export-restore-contract.md: account export and restore contract present
- docs/architecture/canonical-token-philosophy.md: canonical token philosophy present

### Warnings
- docs/architecture/runtime-protocol-token-contract.md says canonical tokens are shared vocabulary, not proof that every state is emitted end-to-end.

### Manual Review Prompts
- Do provider state, request state, and message-versus-attempt identity still match the live runtime and shared frontend surfaces?
- Are export and restore lineage guarantees enforced in code for the currently supported artifact families?
- Have any newer docs or routes started using ad hoc runtime literals outside the canonical token lane?

## Surface Coherence

- Status: `WARN`
- Summary: Checks that the major overview, diagram, and workspace-surface documents exist, while surfacing that diagram freshness and validity are governed separately.

### Evidence
- docs/architecture/system-overview.md: system overview present
- docs/architecture/runtime-diagrams-v1.md: runtime diagrams present
- docs/architecture/ui-diagrams-v1.md: UI diagrams present
- docs/architecture/codexify_workspace_surface_spec_v_1.md: workspace surface spec present
- docs/architecture/diagram-governance.md: diagram governance and freshness workflow present

### Warnings
- docs/architecture/diagram-governance.md defines separate review-marker freshness checks; this scaffold does not run those freshness validations.
- docs/architecture/kb-validity-matrix.md warns that some supporting docs are supplementary or quarantined, so cross-surface alignment still requires human judgment.

### Manual Review Prompts
- Do the runtime and UI diagram packs still match the supported path after recent shell and runtime-state changes?
- Does the workspace surface spec stay clearly separated from runtime/operator truth in surrounding docs?
- If a contributor started from the README, would they reach the right authoritative surface before reading diagrams?

## Governance Integrity

- Status: `WARN`
- Summary: Checks whether the main governance, validity, and risk surfaces exist, while preserving that governance text is not the same thing as enforced coverage.

### Evidence
- docs/architecture/agent-protocol-operations.md: agent protocol operations index present
- docs/architecture/kb-validity-matrix.md: KB validity matrix present
- docs/architecture/tech-debt-and-risks.md: tech debt and risks register present
- docs/iddb_policy_v1.md: IDDB policy present at canonical repo path

### Warnings
- Governance docs describe boundaries and rituals, but repo-local presence alone does not prove enforcement coverage across every route, worker, or extension seam.

### Manual Review Prompts
- Which identity, sovereignty, and permission boundaries are enforced in code today versus documented as doctrine only?
- Does current release language still stay narrower than the governance corpus, especially around delegation, plugins, and autonomy?
- Are known tech-debt items tracked in the places an operator will actually read before signoff?

## Extension Discipline

- Status: `WARN`
- Summary: Checks that extension doctrine, bounded tool-loop contract, Pi boundary contract, and canonical command-bus source paths are present without promoting deferred execution surfaces into shipped authority.

### Evidence
- docs/architecture/self-extending-agent-plugin-system.md: self-extending agent plugin system doc present
- docs/architecture/agent-tool-loop-contract.md: agent tool-loop contract present
- guardian/routes/command_bus.py: command bus route source present
- guardian/command_bus/contracts.py: command bus contract source present
- guardian/command_bus/invoke.py: command bus invoke path present
- docs/architecture/pi-invocation-boundary-contract.md: Pi invocation boundary contract present

### Warnings
- docs/architecture/self-extending-agent-plugin-system.md explicitly says several extension surfaces remain bounded, deferred, or non-runtime.
- docs/architecture/00-current-state.md keeps command bus and adjacent extension surfaces outside the present release promise.

### Manual Review Prompts
- Are any UI, docs, or operator surfaces implying autonomous extension execution that the bounded command-bus lane does not actually provide?
- Does Pi-like invocation remain clearly separated from provider ownership, transcript ownership, and command-bus authority?
- If an extension feature is described as available, can the repo prove whether it is manual, bounded, internal-only, or release-supported?

## Narrative Readiness

- Status: `WARN`
- Summary: Checks that the architecture entrypoint, atlas, doctrine, and current-state release framing exist and that the public-facing narrative still defers to fresh live proof.

### Evidence
- docs/architecture/README.md: architecture KB entrypoint present
- docs/architecture/architecture-atlas.md: architecture atlas present
- docs/architecture/00-current-state.md: current-state release definition anchor present
- docs/architecture/unity-audit-doctrine.md: Unity Audit doctrine present
- docs/architecture/README.md: README references the Unity Audit doctrine
- docs/architecture/00-current-state.md: current-state includes an explicit release definition section

### Warnings
- docs/architecture/00-current-state.md keeps release narrative dependent on fresh live proof rather than documentation presence alone.

### Manual Review Prompts
- Would a new reader understand that Unity Audit is a coherence scaffold, not a governance oracle or runtime proof engine?
- Does the architecture README route release-confidence questions to current-state before broader narrative docs?
- Are any outward-facing summaries claiming more readiness than the latest live supported-path proof actually demonstrates?

## Manual Review Required

- Which supported-path live proof artifact is the freshness anchor for the current main tip?
- Do current health surfaces and worker proofs still match the claims in 00-current-state.md?
- If runtime behavior drifted recently, has current-state been refreshed before using this audit for release confidence?
- Do provider state, request state, and message-versus-attempt identity still match the live runtime and shared frontend surfaces?
- Are export and restore lineage guarantees enforced in code for the currently supported artifact families?
- Have any newer docs or routes started using ad hoc runtime literals outside the canonical token lane?
- Do the runtime and UI diagram packs still match the supported path after recent shell and runtime-state changes?

- Are any UI, docs, or operator surfaces implying autonomous extension execution that the bounded command-bus lane does not actually provide?
- Does Pi-like invocation remain clearly separated from provider ownership, transcript ownership, and command-bus authority?
- If an extension feature is described as available, can the repo prove whether it is manual, bounded, internal-only, or release-supported?

- Does the architecture README route release-confidence questions to current-state before broader narrative docs?
- Are any outward-facing summaries claiming more readiness than the latest live supported-path proof actually demonstrates?

This audit is a coherence scaffold. It does not replace live runtime proof, ADR review, or release signoff.
