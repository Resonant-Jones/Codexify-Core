# Guardian Work Brief - Axis Brief - 2026-06-15

## Scope
Restore and use the repeatable Guardian Work Brief generation path for 2026-06-15. This packet is reporting-only. It does not generate marketing packets, daily audits, heartbeat bundles, public exports, release claims, or runtime proof.

## Current Workspace State
- Repo root: `/Users/chriscastillo/.codex/worktrees/5ab6/Codexify-main`
- Branch: `codex/guardian-work-brief`
- Head: `21cc2131ea20`
- Upstream: origin/codex/guardian-work-brief; ahead 0, behind 0
- Status command: `git status --short --branch --untracked-files=all`

## Runtime Truth Boundary
`docs/architecture/00-current-state.md` remains the short-horizon authority for supported release truth. Runtime paths were not re-proven by this generator.

Current phase from the truth boundary:

> Codexify is in local-first beta hardening on `main`. The supported path remains the local Docker Compose stack with local-only provider posture. Recent `main` changes improved operator visibility, added a site-ready documentation export bundle, and added local runtime presets for Whoosh'd/MLX, Ollama, LM Studio, and custom OpenAI-compatible endpoints, but they do not widen the release promise.

Do not widen release claims from this packet:
- Do not assume cloud-provider beta support.
- Do not assume the packaged desktop shell replaces the local Compose supported path.
- Do not assume command bus, delegation, federation, or graph write surfaces are part of the present release promise.
- Do not assume the Guardian delegation loop contract means the end-to-end delegation loop is shipped.
- Do not assume the Guardian Retrieval Navigation Model, adaptive route hints, reviewable graph evolution proposals, or self-improving memory are shipped runtime features.
- Do not assume the local-model draft adapter is connected to Heartbeat, publishing, scheduling, command dispatch, or release approval.
- Do not assume UI dispatch, lease allocation, live agent execution, or merge automation are release-proven.
- Do not assume Guardian Build Loop doctrine means autonomous self-modification, auto-merge, push, or release-ready coding-worker behavior.
- Do not assume Build Proposal generation means approval, execution, release support, runtime proof, or autonomous self-modification.
- Do not assume any local runtime is available without live endpoint/model inventory proof.
- Do not infer desktop packaging readiness from architecture docs alone.
- Do not infer a wider release promise from docs-only exports, scaffolds, or audit artifacts.

## Axis Read
The useful move is to make the operator brief repeatable while keeping it below runtime machinery. Treat this packet as a drift and decision surface, not as evidence that queues, workers, providers, databases, SSE, Docker Compose, frontend paths, or model runtimes are healthy today.

## Minimal Viable Network
- Nodes: local operator workstation, local git checkout, generated work-brief directory, and human reviewer.
- Trust boundaries: repository boundary, branch/worktree boundary, and current-state documentation boundary.
- Threat model: honest-but-buggy automation and branch drift. This task does not model malicious peers or compromised runtime nodes.
- State ownership: git owns repository state; `00-current-state.md` owns release-truth interpretation; generated briefs own only dated reporting.
- Consistency target: deterministic local reporting for the same date and repo snapshot.
- Conflict policy: human-in-the-loop; `00-current-state.md` wins over older planning docs.

## What Breaks First
- Queue-coupled chat still depends on Redis plus worker health.
- Canonical and legacy config paths still coexist, so startup and operator state can drift.
- Legacy `/tools` behavior still overlaps with the command bus.
- End-to-end Guardian delegation is not yet a release-supported path.
- Federation remains a high-blast-radius area with trust-policy and egress sensitivity.
- Docs-heavy merged work does not remove the need to recheck runtime proof on the supported path.

## Recommended Focus
Review the generated evidence, classify any branch/worktree drift, and select the next human-approved implementation or verification slice. Do not treat this brief as runtime proof.
