# 2026-05-04 Image Turn Containment Proof

## Scope
Live supported-path proof attempt for image-turn containment on the local Docker Compose stack. This run checked whether an image turn in one thread would avoid contamination from:
- a prior assistant vision refusal in another thread
- a prior assistant vision refusal in the same thread
- ordinary retrieval widening beyond the active thread
- the operator-visible RAG trace/debug payload

This document records the live evidence exactly as observed. It does not claim release readiness.

## Environment
- Branch: `codex/add-vision-capability-validation`
- HEAD: `65385db781f6f7f523661df09dafe19406dcdf0b`
- Runtime path: local Docker Compose (`docker-compose.runtime.yml`)
- Services started: `backend`, `db`, `frontend`, `neo4j`, `redis`, `worker-chat`, `worker-chat-embed`, `worker-document-embed`, `worker-voice`, `worker-warmup`
- Supported profile posture: healthy local runtime on the live stack
- Provider selected in health: `local`
- Runtime model selected in health: `library2/ministral-3:8b`
- Requested completion model: `medgemma:4b-it-q8_0`
- Model actually resolved in the completion payload: `library2/ministral-3:8b`

## Commits Under Proof
- `d4510c6f providers: validate image turns against vision capability`
- `a0a2925a providers: preserve local caption fallback for image turns`
- `2df245ec context: enforce thread-first retrieval boundaries`
- `65385db diagnostics: expose retrieval provenance and suppression reasons`

## Health And Supported-Profile Evidence
- `GET /health` returned:
  - `status: ok`
  - `service: core`
- `GET /health/chat` returned a healthy chat runtime:
  - `ok: true`
  - `status: healthy`
  - `redis: ok`
  - `worker.status: fresh`
  - `queue.depth: 0`
  - `completion_service.ok: true`
  - `provider: local`
  - `model: library2/ministral-3:8b`
  - `provider_runtime.models[0].supports_vision: false`
- `GET /api/health/llm` returned `status: ok` / `status: online` with the same local provider/model posture.
- The supported runtime was healthy, but the active local model on this run was the non-vision `library2/ministral-3:8b`.

## Fixture Setup
### Thread A refusal source
- Thread A id: `4`
- User seed message id: `17`
  - content: `Thread A setup: please inspect the image.`
- Assistant refusal message id: `18`
  - content: `I can't view the image.`

### Thread B image turn
- Thread B id: `5`
- Same-thread refusal seed message id: `20`
  - content: `I can't view the image.`
- Image-turn user message id: `21`
  - content included the supported attachment markers:
    - `<!-- cfy-media:image:ec94fdd9-f767-4e7e-aa8e-ff768289e376 -->`
    - `<!-- cfy-media-src:/media/images/20260504-c3aa7880--image-turn-proof-b5b6adddd47b45ad875147378836322c.png?sig=... -->`
    - `<!-- cfy-media-name:image-turn-proof-b5b6adddd47b45ad875147378836322c.png -->`
  - file upload was performed through `POST /api/media/upload/image`

## Completion Execution Evidence
- Request endpoint: `POST /api/chat/5/complete`
- Request body included:
  - `provider: local`
  - `model: medgemma:4b-it-q8_0`
  - `depth_mode: normal`
  - `source_mode: project`
  - `turn_id: 00b1722b-d912-45cf-88b2-b17a1b5d8a88`
- Completion task id: `06e82d16-02f8-4695-8f07-a775b348956e`
- Completion-persisted assistant message id: `22`
- Final model actually resolved in the live payload:
  - `library2/ministral-3:8b`
- Final provider actually resolved in the live payload:
  - `local`
- Provider capability lane observed in the live payload:
  - no `image_routing_path` was surfaced in the durable completion event row for this thread
- Assistant response:
  - did not repeat `I can't view the image.`
  - instead described a portrait-like scene that does not match the uploaded 1x1 PNG

## Retrieval/RAG Trace Evidence
- `GET /api/chat/debug/rag-trace/5/latest` returned an empty public trace shell:
  - `documents: []`
  - `graph: []`
  - no surfaced `retrieval_policy`
  - no surfaced `retrieval_provenance`
  - no surfaced `retrieval_suppression`
- `GET /api/chat/debug/evals/5/latest` returned a trace snapshot with:
  - `trace_snapshot.task_id: 06e82d16-02f8-4695-8f07-a775b348956e`
  - `trace_snapshot.trace.documents`: four semantically retrieved snippets
  - `trace_snapshot.trace.retrieval_plan.retrieval_needed: true`
  - `trace_snapshot.trace.retrieval_plan.allow_global_fallback: false`
  - `trace_snapshot.trace.widen_reason: insufficient_thread_hits`
  - `trace_snapshot.trace.effective_policy.source_mode: project`
  - `trace_snapshot.trace.retrieval_target: latest_turn`
  - no surfaced `retrieval_policy`
  - no surfaced `retrieval_suppression`
  - no surfaced `retrieval_provenance`
- The durable `events_outbox` row for this task also showed:
  - `payload_summary.final_model: library2/ministral-3:8b`
  - `payload_summary.image_routing_path: null`
  - `payload_summary.retrieval_policy: null`
  - `payload_summary.retrieval_provenance: null`
  - `payload_summary.retrieval_suppression: null`
- Thread A refusal text did not appear in the assistant output or in the trace snippets I captured.
- However, because the live trace payload did not surface the provenance/suppression fields required by the proof contract, I cannot claim machine-readable proof that Thread A was excluded from Thread B context.

## Result
FAIL

## Limitations
- The live runtime was healthy, but the completion payload on this run resolved to `library2/ministral-3:8b`, not the requested `medgemma:4b-it-q8_0`.
- The public rag-trace endpoint was empty for the completed proof thread.
- The durable trace snapshot existed in `events_outbox`, but it did not expose the required `retrieval_policy`, `retrieval_provenance`, `retrieval_suppression`, or `image_routing_path` fields for this run.
- The assistant response did not echo the seeded refusal, but the trace payload did not provide enough provenance to prove containment conclusively.
- `pnpm test` was not rerun in this proof attempt; prior validation in this checkout has already been blocked by unresolved Vitest resolution in the frontend workspace.
- This document is not a durable forensic record. It is a live proof attempt on the current runtime only.

## Follow-Up Recommendations
1. Rebuild and rerun the local runtime from the current checkout so the live services reflect the current trace/provenance contract.
2. Re-run the same two-thread image proof and verify that the completion payload now includes `retrieval_policy`, `retrieval_provenance`, `retrieval_suppression`, and `image_routing_path`.
3. Confirm why the completion request resolved to `library2/ministral-3:8b` instead of the requested local vision-capable model override.
4. Once the runtime is refreshed, repeat the proof and only then claim containment on the live path.
5. The current branch now promotes completion and eval snapshot metadata into the live trace route; rerun the proof against refreshed services to confirm the operator-visible payload now includes `retrieval_policy`, `retrieval_provenance`, `retrieval_suppression`, `image_routing_path`, and model-selection fields on the supported path.

### Health And Supported-Profile Evidence
- `GET /health` returned `200` with `status: ok`.
- `GET /health/chat` returned `200` with:
  - `status: healthy`
  - `provider: local`
  - `model: library2/ministral-3:8b`
  - `provider_runtime.models[0].supports_vision: false`
- `GET /api/health/llm` returned `200` with `status: ok` / `status: online`.
- `GET /api/llm/catalog` returned a live catalog that included the local nonvision model plus vision-capable local models such as `medgemma:4b-it-q8_0`.

### Fixture Setup
- Thread A refusal source:
  - Thread A id: `6`
  - user message id: `23`
  - assistant refusal message id: `24`
  - assistant content: `I can't view the image.`
- Thread B image turn:
  - Thread B id: `7`
  - image upload id: `c6a89d26-8854-4117-a580-8bf6eafc6af9`
  - image upload result: `POST /api/media/upload/image` returned a signed `src_url`
  - user message id: `25`
  - user content included the supported `cfy-media` attachment markers

### Completion Execution Evidence
- Request endpoint: `POST /api/chat/7/complete`
- Request body included:
  - `provider: local`
  - `model: medgemma:4b-it-q8_0`
  - `depth_mode: normal`
  - `source_mode: project`
  - `turn_id: 4f7aa578-3eda-4ca6-92f5-cedb45cf482b`
- Task id: `dd96dc0e-269c-4e6c-9533-61cd115343d8`
- Assistant message id: `26`
- Requested provider/model: `local` / `medgemma:4b-it-q8_0`
- Final provider/model: `local` / `library2/ministral-3:8b`
- Image-routing path: not surfaced in the live task/event/debug payloads for this run

### Live RAG Trace Evidence
- `GET /api/chat/debug/rag-trace/7/latest` returned an empty public shell:
  - `documents: []`
  - `graph: []`
  - `model_mode: cloud`
  - `widen_reason: none`
  - no surfaced `retrieval_policy`
  - no surfaced `retrieval_provenance`
  - no surfaced `retrieval_suppression`
  - no surfaced `image_routing_path`
- `GET /api/chat/debug/evals/7/latest` returned a trace snapshot whose `payload_summary` and `metadata` exposed:
  - `requested_model: medgemma:4b-it-q8_0`
  - `final_model: library2/ministral-3:8b`
  - `selection_source: LOCAL_CHAT_MODEL`
  - `policy_reason: LOCAL_CHAT_MODEL`
  - `retrieval_summary.retrieval_query: Attached image: image-containment-proof.png ...`
  - `retrieval_provenance: null`
- The `task.completed` event stream exposed the same model-selection truth:
  - `attempted_model: medgemma:4b-it-q8_0`
  - `final_model: library2/ministral-3:8b`
  - `selection_source: LOCAL_CHAT_MODEL`
  - `retrieval_provenance: null`
- Thread A refusal text did not appear in Thread B messages.
- The assistant response on Thread B was a refusal-like answer, but the live trace still did not provide machine-readable evidence that this came from supported image routing rather than model behavior.

### Result Interpretation
- Containment is still not machine-readably proven on the live supported path.
- The proof did not establish image interpretation fidelity.
- The live path now exposes requested/final model-selection truth in eval/task metadata, but the public rag-trace endpoint still did not surface the promoted retrieval policy, provenance, suppression, or image-routing fields.

### Limitations
- RAG trace remains transient and not a durable forensic store.
- The live debug trace route still returned an empty shell for this thread.
- The completion path still resolved the requested vision-capable override to `library2/ministral-3:8b`.
- The task-event and eval surfaces showed model-selection truth, but not the retrieval provenance/suppression fields required for a containment PASS.
- The backend refresh required `docker compose up -d --no-deps ...` after the migrator failed, so the refresh step itself is an environmental blocker worth tracking separately.

### Follow-Up Recommendations
1. Fix the remaining live trace promotion gap so `GET /api/chat/debug/rag-trace/{thread_id}/latest` surfaces the same completion and retrieval truth already visible in eval/task metadata.
2. Confirm whether the image turn is still being routed through the nonvision local model because of policy selection or an unresolved adapter path.
3. Rerun the same proof only after the live trace route exposes `retrieval_policy`, `retrieval_provenance`, `retrieval_suppression`, and `image_routing_path` for the supported path.

## Remediation note — syntax regression gate repair

- Repaired remaining Python syntax/collection blockers in:
  - `guardian/core/chat_completion_service.py`
  - `tests/context/test_retrieval_trace_provenance.py`
  - `tests/routes/test_image_turn_live_trace_contract.py`
  - `tests/contracts/test_protocol_tokens.py`
  - `tests/routes/test_chat_profile_trace.py`
  - plus one additional discovered syntax blocker in `guardian/routes/chat.py` needed for collection.
- This task repaired syntax/collection validity only and did not change image-routing behavior policy.
- The live image-turn blocker remains unresolved: known image turns can still persist `image_routing_path: null` and `image_routing_absence_reason: null` on the live proof path unless addressed by a separate runtime behavior fix task.

### Remediation Note — syntax gate blockers (2026-05-07)
- The remaining Python syntax/collection blockers were repaired for:
  - `guardian/core/chat_completion_service.py`
  - `tests/context/test_retrieval_trace_provenance.py`
  - `tests/routes/test_image_turn_live_trace_contract.py`
  - `tests/contracts/test_protocol_tokens.py`
  - `tests/routes/test_chat_profile_trace.py`
- This remediation pass was scoped to syntax/collection validity only; it did not attempt to resolve live image-routing behavior.
- The live image-turn blocker remains unresolved: known image turns can still end with `image_routing_path: null` and `image_routing_absence_reason: null` unless fixed in a separate runtime behavior task.

### Remediation Note — broker syntax blocker
- The broader regression slice was blocked by a `SyntaxError` in `guardian/context/broker.py` near line `1582`.
- This task fixed only that broker syntax blocker (no retrieval-policy, provider-selection, queue, or image-routing behavior changes were made).
- The live image-turn blocker from the latest provenance-valid rerun remains unresolved: known image turns still finalized with `image_routing_path: null` and `image_routing_absence_reason: null` unless fixed in a separate runtime task.

### 6. Requested/Final Model And Substitution Reason
- requested provider/model: `local / medgemma:4b-it-q8_0`
- final provider/model: `local / library2/ministral-3:8b`
- `selection_source`: `LOCAL_CHAT_MODEL`
- `policy_reason`: `LOCAL_CHAT_MODEL`
- `fallback_reason`: `null`
- `model_resolution.message`: `requested model 'medgemma:4b-it-q8_0' was overridden by configured local chat model 'library2/ministral-3:8b' from LOCAL_CHAT_MODEL`

### 7. Image-Routing Evidence
- image payload marker evidence (Thread B user message):
  - `<!-- cfy-media:image:... -->` present
  - `<!-- cfy-media-src:... -->` present
  - `<!-- cfy-media-name:... -->` present
- image attachment count:
  - not surfaced on final completion trace surfaces (`null` where inspected)
- assistant metadata image-routing fields:
  - `image_routing_path: null`
  - `image_routing_absence_reason: null`
- `task.completed` top-level image-routing fields:
  - `image_routing_path: null`
  - `image_routing_absence_reason: null`
- `task.completed` nested trace image-routing fields:
  - `image_routing_path: null`
  - `image_routing_absence_reason: null`
- eval snapshot (`GET /api/chat/debug/evals/27/latest`) image-routing fields:
  - `trace_snapshot.image_routing_path: null`
  - `trace_snapshot.image_routing_absence_reason: null`
- rag-trace (`GET /api/chat/debug/rag-trace/27/latest`) image-routing fields:
  - top-level `image_routing_path: null`
  - top-level `image_routing_absence_reason: null`
  - promoted `image_routing` object: empty (`{}`)

### 8. Trace Evidence Summary
- retrieval policy:
  - present on rag-trace (`retrieval_policy.source_mode: project`, boundary `same_user_same_project`)
- retrieval provenance:
  - `null` on rag-trace and `null` in eval `trace_snapshot`
- retrieval suppression:
  - present on rag-trace (`count: 2`; policy suppression lanes include `thread_semantic_excluded_by_policy` and `global_search_excluded_by_policy`)
- retrieval execution and absence fields:
  - rag-trace `retrieval_executed: null`
  - rag-trace `retrieval_absence_reason: null`
  - eval `trace_snapshot.retrieval_executed: null`
  - eval `trace_snapshot.retrieval_absence_reason: null`
- model selection:
  - present and machine-readable on rag-trace (`requested_model`, `final_model`, `selection_source`, `policy_reason`, `fallback_reason`, `model_resolution.message`)
- `assistant_vision_refusal_on_image_turn`:
  - not present in the persisted/eval/rag-trace surfaces for this run
- `trace_unavailable_reason` behavior:
  - cleared/absent once persisted snapshot existed (`null` on rag-trace latest)

### 9. Thread A Leakage Check
- Thread A refusal text (`I can't view the image.`) in Thread B messages: no
- Thread A refusal text in terminal task payload: no
- Thread A refusal text in eval latest payload: no
- Thread A refusal text in rag-trace latest payload: no

### 10. Containment Verdict
- machine-readably proven: no
- reason:
  - known image turn evidence exists (canonical `cfy-media` markers on Thread B user message), but final completion surfaces still end with:
    - `image_routing_path: null`
    - `image_routing_absence_reason: null`
  - under the stricter current contract, known image turns cannot finalize with null/null image-routing truth.

### 11. Limitations
- This rerun reused provenance-passing runtime containers and did not rebuild services again.
- The assistant response remained refusal-like while image-routing truth stayed null/null, so route/eval surfaces still cannot separate policy/model behavior from image-routing truth.
- `retrieval_provenance` and retrieval executed/absence status remained incomplete on the eval snapshot path for this run.

### 12. Remaining Blockers
- Known image turns still finalize with null/null image-routing truth on assistant metadata, task.completed, eval snapshot, and rag-trace surfaces.
- Image-turn containment remains not machine-readably proven under the stricter contract.
- Compose migrator issue remains outside this task.
- Vitest resolution remains outside this task.

- Compose migrator issue remains outside this task
- frontend Vitest resolution remains outside this task

### Remediation Note — runtime commit provenance classification
- Investigation confirmed the prior backend runtime commit hint `7a6b5c4d3e2f` came from startup migration logging, not from an authoritative runtime git-commit surface:
  - `docker compose logs --no-color backend | rg -n "alembic_version|Verifying required tables"`
  - `[Backend] Verifying required tables + alembic_version`
  - `[Backend] OK: alembic_version=7a6b5c4d3e2f`
- The provenance helper now classifies commit signals by trust class:
  - `authoritative_runtime_commit`
  - `build_metadata_commit`
  - `log_hint_commit`
  - `unavailable`
  - `untrusted`
- The helper now fails closed on authoritative commit mismatch, but does **not** fail solely on untrusted/log-hint mismatch when stronger evidence is otherwise valid.
- The helper now requires local-head lineage containment of the required worker image-routing fix commit (`2bce6aeb9416a25d77b931b4974db7573e8951b8`) before proof-ready can be true.
- Current gate run after the classification fix still reports `proof_ready: false` because:
  - local `HEAD` does not contain required lineage commit `2bce6aeb...`
  - backend and worker containers were created before the selected expected commit timestamp
- Trusted provenance source going forward:
  - local git head equality + required-fix lineage check + container creation-time freshness + worker heartbeat + green health surfaces
  - authoritative runtime commit (if surfaced) remains a hard mismatch gate
- Containment rerun status: **not ready yet** (provenance gate still fail-closed on lineage/freshness checks).

## Runtime provenance gate — before next containment rerun

### Result
FAIL

### Environment
- branch: `codex/add-vision-capability-validation`
- local HEAD: `49eefa02f80e939f709708f148a408e366fea59a`
- expected commit under proof: `2bce6aeb9416a25d77b931b4974db7573e8951b8`
- runtime path: `/Volumes/Dev_SSD/Codexify-main`
- runtime refresh command:
  - `docker compose up -d --build --no-deps backend worker-chat`
- provenance helper command:
  - `./.venv/bin/python scripts/proofs/prove_image_turn_containment_runtime_provenance.py --expected-commit 2bce6aeb9416a25d77b931b4974db7573e8951b8`

### Gate Preconditions
- Local checkout ancestry requirement was not satisfied:
  - `git merge-base --is-ancestor 2bce6aeb9416a25d77b931b4974db7573e8951b8 HEAD` -> exit `1`
  - `git merge-base --is-ancestor 49eefa02f80e939f709708f148a408e366fea59a HEAD` -> exit `0`
- This means the active checkout is at `49eefa02...` and is not a descendant containing `2bce6aeb...`.

### Health and Heartbeat Summary
- `GET /health` -> `200`, `status: ok`
- `GET /health/chat` -> `200`, `status: healthy`
- `GET /api/health/llm` -> `200`, `status: ok`
- `GET /api/llm/catalog` -> `200`
- Worker heartbeat -> `fresh` (`heartbeat_age_seconds: 2.021`)

### Proof Readiness Decision
- `proof_ready: false`
- The gate failed closed due to commit provenance mismatch (both local HEAD and backend runtime commit hint).
- No new image-turn containment rerun was executed after this gate failure.

### Remaining Blockers
- Runtime provenance is not valid for interpreting a new containment rerun against `2bce6aeb...`.
- Local checkout/head mismatch: `49eefa02...` vs expected `2bce6aeb...`.
- Backend runtime commit hint mismatch: `7a6b5c4d3e2f` vs expected `2bce6aeb...`.
- Compose migrator issue remains outside this task.
- Frontend Vitest resolution remains outside this task.

## Runtime provenance repair attempt

### Result
FAIL

### Selected Expected Commit
- selected expected commit: `0ee170770a1bd0a7d4d3d149ecfa1bd7bfa5eb05`
- reason:
  - This is the active local checkout HEAD used to build the live backend/worker containers during this repair attempt.
  - It is a docs-only descendant of `49eefa02f80e939f709708f148a408e366fea59a`, so runtime code intent is unchanged from that local runtime lineage.
  - The older target `2bce6aeb9416a25d77b931b4974db7573e8951b8` is present in object history but is not an ancestor of the active checkout branch in this workspace.

### Lineage Evidence
- local git HEAD: `0ee170770a1bd0a7d4d3d149ecfa1bd7bfa5eb05`
- expected commit under this repair run: `0ee170770a1bd0a7d4d3d149ecfa1bd7bfa5eb05`
- whether local HEAD contains `2bce6aeb9416a25d77b931b4974db7573e8951b8`: **no**
  - `git merge-base --is-ancestor 2bce6aeb9416a25d77b931b4974db7573e8951b8 HEAD` -> exit `1`
- worker final image-routing normalization fix in selected lineage (`2bce6aeb...` as a direct ancestor): **not proven by ancestry in this checkout**

### Runtime Refresh
- rebuild/recreate command:
  - `docker compose up -d --build --no-deps backend worker-chat`

### Provenance Helper Run
- command:
  - `./.venv/bin/python scripts/proofs/prove_image_turn_containment_runtime_provenance.py --expected-commit 0ee170770a1bd0a7d4d3d149ecfa1bd7bfa5eb05`

### Health and Worker Heartbeat

- `GET /api/health/llm` -> `200`, `status: ok`
- `GET /api/llm/catalog` -> `200`
- worker heartbeat status -> `fresh`

### Proof-Readiness Decision
- provenance gate remains **FAIL**
- no full image-turn containment proof rerun was executed after this failed provenance gate

### Remaining Blockers
- helper fail-closed on backend runtime commit hint mismatch:
  - backend logs expose `alembic_version=7a6b5c4d3e2f`
  - helper interprets that as runtime commit and compares it to expected git commit SHA
- local ancestry does not show `2bce6aeb...` as an ancestor of the active checkout lineage
- Compose migrator issue remains outside this task
- Vitest/frontend resolution remains outside this task

## Rerun — after 2bce6ae worker final image-routing normalization

## Provenance Remediation
- The most recent rerun was executed while the local checkout HEAD was `c088cf59`, not `2bce6aeb9416a25d77b931b4974db7573e8951b8`.
- That makes the rerun a stale-runtime evidence sample, not a valid validation or invalidation of the intended worker normalization fix.
- Before any future image-turn containment rerun is interpreted, the runtime provenance helper must pass first:
  - `scripts/proofs/prove_image_turn_containment_runtime_provenance.py --expected-commit 2bce6aeb9416a25d77b931b4974db7573e8951b8`
- Until provenance validation passes, the image-turn containment proof remains blocked on runtime freshness rather than containment semantics.

### Result
FAIL

### Environment
- branch: `codex/add-vision-capability-validation`
- HEAD: `c088cf59` (`docs: note live trace snapshot persistence verification`)
- runtime path: `/Volumes/Dev_SSD/Codexify-main`
- services refreshed: `backend`, `worker-chat`
- refresh command: `docker compose up -d --build --no-deps backend worker-chat`

### Health Evidence Summary
- `GET /health` returned `200 ok`
- `GET /health/chat` returned `200 healthy` with a fresh worker heartbeat
- `GET /api/health/llm` returned `200 ok / online`
- `GET /api/llm/catalog` returned `200` and still listed `medgemma:4b-it-q8_0` as vision-capable

### Thread Setup
- Thread A id: `24`
- Thread A refusal message id: `40`
- Thread B id: `25`
- Thread B user image message id: `41`
- Thread B assistant message id: `42`

- turn id: `91b94bce-bba2-45cf-8861-55e1d7cda573`

### Requested / Final Model
- requested provider/model: `local` / `medgemma:4b-it-q8_0`
- final provider/model: `local` / `library2/ministral-3:8b`
- `selection_source`: `LOCAL_CHAT_MODEL`
- `policy_reason`: `LOCAL_CHAT_MODEL`
- `fallback_reason`: `null`
- `model_resolution.message`: `requested model 'medgemma:4b-it-q8_0' was overridden by configured local chat model 'library2/ministral-3:8b' from LOCAL_CHAT_MODEL`
- note: the terminal task event carried `model: library2/ministral-3:8b`, while the completion payload summary still exposed the stale attempted-model slot in its nested `final_model` field

### Image-Routing Evidence
- Thread B user content carried the supported `cfy-media` attachment markers:
  - `<!-- cfy-media:image:58494361-dd98-46f5-b887-3e70f812c719 -->`
  - `<!-- cfy-media-src:/media/images/20260507-499a439a--proof.png?sig=nZZm2hKgqilU24SoVxlGnfahComEvYlbN7cLrxm2J_A -->`
  - `<!-- cfy-media-name:proof.png -->`
- `image_attachment_count` did not surface in the assistant metadata, task.completed payload, eval snapshot, or promoted rag-trace object for this run
- assistant metadata image-routing fields: absent
- task.completed top-level image-routing fields: absent
- task.completed nested trace image-routing fields: absent
- eval snapshot image-routing fields: absent
- public rag-trace top-level image-routing fields:
  - `image_routing_path: null`
  - `image_attachment_count: null`
  - no canonical `image_routing_absence_reason` surfaced
- public rag-trace promoted `image_routing` object: absent
- `assistant_vision_refusal_on_image_turn` did not appear in the persisted trace for this run

### Trace Evidence Summary
- retrieval policy was present in the nested task.completed trace, eval snapshot trace, and public rag-trace
- retrieval suppression was present in the nested task.completed trace, eval snapshot trace, and public rag-trace
- retrieval provenance was not surfaced on the task.completed top-level payload, nested trace, eval snapshot trace, or rag-trace response for this run
- retrieval execution was not surfaced as a stable machine-readable field on the persisted surfaces for this run
- `trace_unavailable_reason` was absent / cleared once the persisted snapshot existed
- `retrieval_query_matches_latest_turn: true` on the persisted trace path

### Thread A Leakage Check
- Thread A refusal text did not appear in Thread B messages, task evidence, eval snapshot, or rag-trace output
- Thread B assistant text was refusal-like, but it was not the seeded Thread A refusal text

### Containment
- No
- containment is not machine-readably proven

### Limitations
- This live rerun still did not surface the canonical image-routing truth on the persisted surfaces for a known image turn
- The current checkout/head for the rerun remained `c088cf59`, so the live runtime did not exhibit the expected final-normalization behavior in this proof pass
- The terminal task event and payload summary still showed model-selection truth, but the image-routing fields were absent rather than normalized into a canonical path or absence reason

### Remaining Blockers
- The live image-turn path still does not expose machine-readable image-routing truth on the persisted/eval/rag-trace surfaces
- The separate Compose migrator issue remains outside this task
- The frontend Vitest resolution issue remains outside this task

### Remediation Note
- Live follow-up verification showed the worker did persist an `eval_trace_snapshots` row for thread `21`, and `GET /api/chat/debug/evals/21/latest` plus `GET /api/chat/debug/rag-trace/21/latest` both returned the snapshot once the completion had settled.
- That means the remaining failure mode was proof timing, not a missing persistence path.
- The proof is ready to rerun against a fresh completion thread if the goal is to re-capture the containment evidence with the now-visible snapshot lane.

- Model resolution message: `requested model 'medgemma:4b-it-q8_0' was overridden by configured local chat model 'library2/ministral-3:8b' from LOCAL_CHAT_MODEL`
- The task-event / assistant metadata path does explain the substitution machine-readably, but the live response still routed to the configured local default model.

### Image-Routing Evidence
- Image payload evidence:
  - reused uploaded image id `fdea58f2-5ea9-43fc-8fe7-1f3ed0f3542e`
  - `src_url`: `/media/images/20260505-64abf93f--image-containment-proof.png?sig=SSoRblzU5_l32SImrU6HvSSAFcrXGNhgYj3kNYuFhZc`
  - message content included the supported attachment markers:
    - `<!-- cfy-media:image:fdea58f2-5ea9-43fc-8fe7-1f3ed0f3542e -->`
    - `<!-- cfy-media-src:/media/images/20260505-64abf93f--image-containment-proof.png?sig=SSoRblzU5_l32SImrU6HvSSAFcrXGNhgYj3kNYuFhZc -->`
    - `<!-- cfy-media-name:image-containment-proof.png -->`
- Image routing path: not surfaced in the live task/event/debug payloads for this run
- Capability lane: the live health/catalog posture still showed the active resolved model as non-vision local, even though the requested model was vision-capable

### RAG/Debug Trace Evidence
- `GET /api/chat/debug/rag-trace/21/latest` returned an empty public shell:
  - `documents: []`
  - `graph: []`
  - `trace_unavailable_reason: trace_source_unavailable`
  - no surfaced `retrieval_policy`
  - no surfaced `retrieval_provenance`
  - no surfaced `retrieval_suppression`
  - no surfaced `image_routing_path`
- `GET /api/chat/debug/evals/21/latest` returned no `trace_snapshot`.
- The completed message metadata and payload_summary did expose:
  - `requested_model: medgemma:4b-it-q8_0`
  - `final_model: library2/ministral-3:8b`
  - `selection_source: LOCAL_CHAT_MODEL`
  - `model_resolution.message` with the substitution reason above
- `assistant_vision_refusal_on_image_turn` did not appear in the live debug trace payload for this run.
- Thread A refusal text did not appear in Thread B messages.
- Thread A refusal text was therefore not visibly leaked into Thread B output, but the live debug trace still did not expose enough provenance/suppression data to prove containment machine-readably.

### Result Interpretation
- Containment is not machine-readably proven on the live supported path.
- The model substitution is explained through `selection_source`, `policy_reason`, and `model_resolution.message`, but `fallback_reason` remained null in the assistant message metadata.
- Image interpretation fidelity was not established because the assistant response remained refusal-like while the public trace surface stayed empty.

### Limitations
- RAG trace remains transient and is not a durable forensic store.
- The live debug trace route still returned an empty shell for this thread, so the required containment fields were still missing.
- The live runtime still resolved the requested vision-capable override to `library2/ministral-3:8b`.
- The task-event and assistant metadata surfaces now explain the substitution, but the public rag-trace route still did not surface `retrieval_policy`, `retrieval_provenance`, `retrieval_suppression`, or `image_routing_path`.
- `pnpm test` was not rerun; the known Vitest resolution issue remains a separate blocker.
- The Compose migrator blocker remains a separate environmental issue and was not addressed here.

### Follow-Up Recommendations
1. Fix the live debug trace promotion path so the supported rag-trace endpoint returns the same completion and retrieval truth already visible in task-event and assistant metadata.
2. Decide whether the live image-turn path should honor the requested vision-capable local override or continue to substitute `LOCAL_CHAT_MODEL`, and keep that choice machine-readable in the public trace.
3. Rerun the proof only after the public trace exposes `retrieval_policy`, `retrieval_provenance`, `retrieval_suppression`, and `image_routing_path` for the supported path.

### Remediation Note
- The live runtime blocker that produced the previous failed rerun was a context-assembly `NameError` at `_normalize_source_mode`; the completion service now calls the imported `normalize_source_mode` helper directly.
- The local model-selection path now emits a machine-readable substitution reason when strict local-only policy overrides an explicit requested model in favor of `LOCAL_CHAT_MODEL`.
- The trace/debug route and the promoted eval snapshot shape remain unchanged by this task; the proof should be rerun against a refreshed runtime so the updated completion path can repopulate the live trace lanes.
- This task makes the live image-turn containment proof ready to rerun, but it does not convert the earlier FAIL sections into PASS.

### Remediation Note
- The live trace blocker was the route reading the wrong eval snapshot shape; the backend now promotes `trace`, `payload_summary`, `retrieval_summary`, and `metadata` from the latest persisted eval snapshot into the public debug RAG trace surface.
- The model-selection truth is already machine-readable in the live task/eval lanes as requested versus final model plus `selection_source` and `policy_reason`; the route now mirrors that truth when the snapshot exists.
- This task makes the containment proof ready to rerun on the live supported path, but it does not rewrite the earlier FAIL result and it does not resolve the separate Compose migrator issue.

- Request body included:
  - `provider: local`
  - `model: medgemma:4b-it-q8_0`
  - `depth_mode: normal`
  - `source_mode: project`
  - `turn_id: 00472bf4-699c-4965-b1c9-c7005a38690b`

- Assistant message id: `43`
- Requested provider/model: `local` / `medgemma:4b-it-q8_0`
- Final provider/model: `local` / `library2/ministral-3:8b`
- Image-routing path: `null` in the live task/event and debug payloads for this run

### Live RAG Trace Evidence
- `GET /api/chat/debug/rag-trace/17/latest` returned `200` and now promoted the real eval snapshot row shape, but it still did not surface the containment fields required for a PASS:
  - no surfaced `retrieval_policy`
  - no surfaced `retrieval_provenance`
  - no surfaced `retrieval_suppression`
  - no surfaced `image_routing_path`
- The route did expose model-selection truth in the promoted payload:
  - `requested_model: medgemma:4b-it-q8_0`
  - `final_model: library2/ministral-3:8b`
  - `selection_source: LOCAL_CHAT_MODEL`
  - `policy_reason: LOCAL_CHAT_MODEL`
- `GET /api/chat/debug/evals/17/latest` returned the same requested/final model-selection truth and showed:
  - `retrieval_summary.retrieval_query: Attached image: image-containment-proof.png ...`
  - `retrieval_provenance: null`
- The `task.completed` event lane for the same task also carried model-selection truth:
  - `attempted_model: medgemma:4b-it-q8_0`
  - `final_model: library2/ministral-3:8b`
  - `selection_source: LOCAL_CHAT_MODEL`
- Thread A refusal text did not appear in Thread B messages.
- The assistant response on Thread B was refusal-like, but the live trace still did not provide machine-readable evidence that this came from supported image routing rather than model behavior.

### Result Interpretation
- Containment is still not machine-readably proven on the live supported path.
- The proof did not establish image interpretation fidelity.
- The live path now exposes requested/final model-selection truth in eval/task metadata, but the public rag-trace endpoint still did not surface the promoted retrieval policy, provenance, suppression, or image-routing fields.

### Limitations
- RAG trace remains transient and is not a durable forensic store.
- The live debug trace route still lacked the required containment fields for this thread.
- The completion path still resolved the requested vision-capable override to `library2/ministral-3:8b`.
- The task-event and eval surfaces showed model-selection truth, but not the retrieval provenance/suppression fields required for a containment PASS.
- The backend refresh required `docker compose up -d --no-deps ...` after the migrator failure, so the refresh step itself remains an environmental blocker worth tracking separately.

### Follow-Up Recommendations
1. Fix the remaining live trace promotion gap so `GET /api/chat/debug/rag-trace/{thread_id}/latest` surfaces the same completion and retrieval truth already visible in eval/task metadata.
2. Confirm whether the image turn is still being routed through the nonvision local model because of policy selection or an unresolved adapter path.
3. Rerun the same proof only after the live trace route exposes `retrieval_policy`, `retrieval_provenance`, `retrieval_suppression`, and `image_routing_path` for the supported path.
