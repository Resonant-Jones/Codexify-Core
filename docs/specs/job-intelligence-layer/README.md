# Job Intelligence Layer

This directory is a docs-first incubation lane for the Job Intelligence Layer concept.
It is not a shipped release surface.

Baseline orientation document:
- [`../job-intelligence-layer-baseline.md`](../job-intelligence-layer-baseline.md)

## Scaffold Map

- [`00-overview.md`](./00-overview.md): Defines the lane purpose, core operational loop, and Codexify incubation framing.
- [`01-mvp-scope.md`](./01-mvp-scope.md): Captures what the first validation MVP includes and explicitly excludes.
- [`02-job-profile-contract-notes.md`](./02-job-profile-contract-notes.md): Records draft Job Profile contract areas and memory doctrine notes before any canonical schema decision.
- [`03-call-assist-workflow.md`](./03-call-assist-workflow.md): Outlines the initial call-assist workflow concept with human review as the control point.
- [`04-vertical-adaptation-notes.md`](./04-vertical-adaptation-notes.md): Tracks portability notes from the seed domain to later vertical candidates.
- [`05-open-questions.md`](./05-open-questions.md): Lists unresolved decisions required before implementation work is justified.
- [`06-job-profile-draft-contract.md`](./06-job-profile-draft-contract.md): Proposes the first non-runtime Job Profile contract draft to structure future schema and review-planning work.
- [`07-extraction-pass-contract.md`](./07-extraction-pass-contract.md): Defines the first planning contract for turning raw intake text into reviewable structured draft extraction outputs.
- [`08-human-review-gate-contract.md`](./08-human-review-gate-contract.md): Defines the planning boundary between generated draft data and future confirmed operational records.
- [`09-lineage-and-revision-contract.md`](./09-lineage-and-revision-contract.md): Defines planning expectations for source traceability, revision history, confirmation lineage, and supersession relationships.
- [`10-mvp-validation-scenario.md`](./10-mvp-validation-scenario.md): Defines the first synthetic MVP scenario and proof expectations before any implementation work begins.
- [`11-prompt-and-pipeline-contract.md`](./11-prompt-and-pipeline-contract.md): Defines the planning decomposition for future pass-based prompt and processing pipeline behavior before runtime implementation.
- [`12-implementation-readiness-plan.md`](./12-implementation-readiness-plan.md): Defines the implementation-readiness boundary and first executable proof constraints before any runtime work begins.

## Synthetic Fixtures

- [`fixtures/plumbing-three-handle-drip/`](./fixtures/plumbing-three-handle-drip/): Synthetic docs-local fixture set for the first future Job Intelligence proof.

## Prompt Templates

- [`prompts/extraction-v0.md`](./prompts/extraction-v0.md): Provides the first docs-local, manual-only extraction prompt template for the synthetic plumbing fixture lane.

## Do Not Assume

- No runtime implementation exists.
- No Job Profile schema is canonical yet.
- No transcription pipeline exists.
- No dispatcher review UI exists.
- No hosted, SaaS, on-prem, or hybrid delivery model has been selected.
