# Module Header + Secondary Pill-Nav Contract v1

> Classification: UI/design canon  
> Scope: Module identity, header structure, local navigation, immediate action layout, and plugin-native presentation rules  
> Not runtime truth: This document does not define backend topology, worker behavior, health semantics, or deployment constraints  
> Interpretation rule: If this document conflicts with the UI token and structural layout canon, the canon wins

## Purpose

Define the canonical presentation contract for **tool-class modules** inside Codexify.

This contract exists to ensure that native tools and third-party plugins share the same structural grammar:

- modules look like modules

- local navigation looks local

- actions appear where users expect them

- content begins immediately

- secondary controls do not dominate the work surface

The goal is not visual sameness for its own sake.  
The goal is **structural consistency with clear role separation**.

---

## Core Thesis

Codexify needs a stable distinction between:

- **app navigation**

- **module identity**

- **module-local navigation**

- **module actions**

- **work content**

Without this distinction, surfaces become crowded, repetitive, and visually ambiguous.

The correct module pattern is:

```text
Module Header
Action Zone
Content Surface
```

Not:

```text
Large title block
Explanatory paragraph
Pane label
Secondary pane
Status strip
Content eventually
```

---

## Canonical Terms

### 1. Codexify Navigational Dock

The global, app-level navigation surface.

Used for:

- Guardian

- Dashboard

- Documents

- Gallery

- Persona Studio

- other top-level routes

This dock is product navigation. It is not module-local navigation.

### 2. Module Header

The top identity band for a tool-class module.

Used for:

- module title

- short descriptor

- small status indicators

- optional right-side actions

The Module Header defines what the tool **is**, not how every internal section works.

### 3. Action Zone

The immediate control strip under the Module Header.

Used for:

- primary local actions

- section switching

- mode changes

- save/reset affordances

- compact local status controls

The Action Zone defines what the user can **do next**.

### 4. Secondary Pill-Nav

A module-scoped pill navigation surface used for local sections, modes, or views within a module.

It is visually related to the Codexify Navigational Dock, but serves **local** movement rather than app-wide route changes.

Examples:

- Identity / Model / Voice / Prompt / Tools / Retrieval / Truth

- Profiles / Diagnostics

- Thread / Project

- Shelf / Scratchpad / Inspector

## Structural Contract

## 1. Module Header

Every tool-class module should begin with a Module Header.

### Required contents

- module title

- short one-line descriptor

### Optional contents

- one small state chip

- one small mode/status token

- compact right-side action group

### Rules

- the descriptor must stay short

- the header must not become a documentation block

- large explanatory copy is prohibited in the primary header region

- the header must not consume unnecessary vertical space

- the header must not contain secondary pane labels like “Utility Pane”

### Design intent

The Module Header should feel like the nameplate on an instrument, not a marketing hero section.

---

## 2. Action Zone

The Action Zone appears immediately under the Module Header.

### Allowed contents

- Secondary Pill-Nav

- mode selectors

- save/reset/import/export controls

- context-sensitive actions

- compact toggle groups

### Rules

- content should begin immediately after the Action Zone

- the Action Zone must remain compact

- the Action Zone must not become a second full header

- controls in this zone should be directly relevant to the current module state

- this zone should minimize eye travel between intent and action

### Design intent

The Action Zone is the user’s handhold.  
It should feel operational, not ceremonial.

---

## 3. Secondary Pill-Nav

Secondary Pill-Nav is optional.  
It should appear only when a module has enough local structure to justify it.

### Use cases

- section switching inside a module

- local view modes

- content scope changes

- editor subsection movement

### Secondary Pill-Nav is

- module-scoped

- optional

- embedded inside the Action Zone or tightly associated with it

- lighter than the Codexify Navigational Dock

- token-governed

### Secondary Pill-Nav is not

- app-wide route navigation

- a branding surface

- a place for explanatory copy

- a substitute for poor information architecture

- a dumping ground for unrelated buttons

### Rules

- only use it when local navigation is genuinely needed

- keep labels concise

- do not overload it with passive status items

- do not mix unrelated actions inside the same pill structure

- selected state must be visually obvious and token-consistent

### Design intent

The Secondary Pill-Nav should feel like an instrument strip, not a second navbar.

---

## 4. Content Surface

After the Module Header and Action Zone, the content surface should begin immediately.

### Rules

- no unnecessary pane titles before content

- no redundant explanatory banners before content

- no repeated identity labels that restate what the header already established

- scrolling should happen in the content region when possible

- header and action zones should ideally remain stable anchors

### Design intent

The user should reach the working surface quickly.

---

## Information Hierarchy Rules

### Rule 1: Identity appears once

The active module identity should be established clearly, then not repeated unnecessarily.

### Rule 2: Secondary surfaces must not dominate

If a surface is supportive rather than primary, it should be:

- collapsible

- switchable

- drawer-based

- or integrated as a local mode

It should not permanently occupy prime vertical space unless the module truly depends on it.

### Rule 3: Explain less, orient better

Do not spend the top of the module on long disclaimers.  
Use short descriptors, tooltips, helper text, or contextual microcopy instead.

### Rule 4: Action precedes bureaucracy

Users should reach an actionable region quickly.

### Rule 5: Module-local controls stay local

Do not blur app navigation and module navigation.

---

## Uniformity Rules for Native Tools and Plugins

Codexify should expose a consistent module grammar for first-party and third-party tools.

### If a surface is a Module, it should use

- Module Header

- Action Zone

- optional Secondary Pill-Nav

- token-governed Content Surface

### If a surface is not a Module, it should follow its own surface class

Examples:

- chat

- gallery

- document viewer

- dashboard grid

- workspace drawer

This distinction is important.  
Not every screen should look like a module.  
But every module should look recognizably like a module.

---

## Native Presentation SDK Implication

This contract is part of the future **Native Presentation SDK**.

The plugin system should provide first-class structural primitives rather than forcing developers to invent their own shell.

### Required plugin-native slots

- `ModuleHeader`

- `ActionZone`

- `ContentSurface`

### Optional plugin-native slots

- `StatusChip`

- `SecondaryPillNav`

- `Inspector`

- `FooterActions`

### SDK rules

- token-only styling

- no ad hoc header invention outside the shell contract

- no arbitrary radii or spacing systems

- no independent layout grammar for module-class plugins

- module-local navigation must use approved Secondary Pill-Nav semantics when appropriate

### Design goal

Make it easy for third-party developers to feel native without reverse-engineering Codexify’s visual logic.

---

## Persona Studio Application

Persona Studio should follow this contract as a flagship module.

### Module Header

- **Persona Studio**

- short descriptor only, such as:

  - _Build and tune runtime personas._

### Action Zone

- Secondary Pill-Nav for local sections

  - Identity

  - Model

  - Voice

  - Prompt

  - Tools

  - Retrieval

  - Truth

- local mode switch

  - Profiles

  - Diagnostics

- save/reset actions

- compact draft state

### Content Surface

- preview harness first

- profile summary second

- section editor third

- truth summary / expandable matrix last

### Boundary note

Persona Studio may support local preview behavior, but it remains configuration-first and must not become a real persisted chat surface.

---

## Notification Placement Rule for Preview Surfaces

When a module includes an ephemeral preview composer, critical input-related warnings should appear in the composer path itself.

For Persona Studio preview specifically:

- no-memory warning belongs in or near the input/composer region

- it should not dominate the global module header

- stronger reminder text should appear only when the user expresses memory intent

This keeps the warning attached to the act of input, where the user is already looking.

---

## Non-Goals

This contract is not:

- a backend spec

- a runtime contract

- a diagnostics data contract

- a chat message UX spec

- a plugin permission/security model

- a requirement that every screen use Secondary Pill-Nav

---

## Adoption Guidance

Apply this contract when:

- creating a new first-party tool surface

- redesigning an existing tool-like interface

- defining plugin-native shells

- deciding whether a control belongs in the header, action zone, or content

Do not apply this contract mechanically to:

- message streams

- passive viewers

- gallery-only surfaces

- simple one-action cards

- app-wide route navigation

---

## Canonical Summary

Codexify module-class tools should follow a stable presentation grammar:

```text
Codexify Navigational Dock
Module Header
Action Zone
Secondary Pill-Nav (when needed)
Content Surface
```

This creates a system where:

- app navigation remains distinct

- module identity is clear

- local controls feel local

- work begins quickly

- plugins can feel native without improvising their own shell
